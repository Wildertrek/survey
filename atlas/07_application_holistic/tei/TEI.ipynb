    "**Theories of Emotional Intelligence (TEI)** encompass various models that aim to conceptualize and measure emotional intelligence, a critical aspect of human psychology related to the recognition, understanding, management, and utilization of emotions. These models provide frameworks for understanding and improving emotional intelligence in individuals. Here, we summarize some of the key models within TEI:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Ability Model:**\n",
    "   - *Perceiving Emotions:* This facet focuses on recognizing emotions in oneself and others, interpreting nonverbal cues, and identifying emotions from facial expressions.\n",
    "   - *Using Emotions:* It involves harnessing emotions to facilitate thinking, using emotions to enhance problem-solving, and employing emotional reasoning.\n",
    "   - *Understanding Emotions:* This component revolves around comprehending emotional language, understanding the causes and consequences of emotions, and recognizing emotional transitions.\n",
    "   - *Managing Emotions:* Managing emotions encompasses regulating one's emotions, responding adaptively to emotional situations, and exercising emotional self-control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Trait Model:**\n",
    "   - *Self-Awareness:* This trait involves being aware of one's emotions and their impact, recognizing emotional strengths and weaknesses, and identifying emotional triggers.\n",
    "   - *Emotional Resilience:* It relates to bouncing back from adversity, effectively handling stress and setbacks, and maintaining a positive outlook.\n",
    "   - *Empathy:* Empathy entails understanding and sharing others' emotions, showing compassion and concern, and engaging in perspective-taking.\n",
    "   - *Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EQ):* EQ measures and assesses emotional intelligence, quantifies emotional competencies, and evaluates emotional self-awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mixed Model:**\n",
    "   - *Self-Awareness:* Similar to the Trait Model, it emphasizes recognizing one's emotions and their effects, understanding strengths and weaknesses, and engaging in emotional self-assessment.\n",
    "   - *Social Awareness:* Social awareness involves perceiving and understanding others' emotions, empathizing with others, and exhibiting social perceptiveness.\n",
    "   - *Self-Management:* This component centers on managing one's emotions, adapting to changing circumstances, and effectively managing anger and stress.\n",
    "   - *Relationship Management:* Relationship management encompasses building and maintaining relationships, influencing and inspiring others, and effectively resolving conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Integrated Model:**\n",
    "   - *Intrapersonal Intelligence:* Intrapersonal intelligence includes self-reflection, self-regulation, and self-motivation.\n",
    "   - *Interpersonal Intelligence:* It involves empathy, social skills, and effective communication.\n",
    "   - *Adaptability:* Adaptability encompasses flexibility, resilience, and the ability to cope with change.\n",
    "   - *Emotional Competence:* Emotional competence comprises emotional self-awareness, emotional regulation, and empathy in relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "These theories of emotional intelligence provide valuable frameworks for understanding and enhancing individuals' emotional competencies. They find applications in various domains, including personal development, leadership, education, and psychology. Researchers and practitioners use these models to assess, train, and promote emotional intelligence, ultimately leading to improved emotional well-being and more effective interpersonal relationships.\n",

    "Timeline and reference table for Theories of Emotional Intelligence (TEI) involves outlining the key developments in the conceptualization and study of emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use, and management of emotion in oneself and others. \n",

    "**Bartle Types (TEI)**, also known as Bartle's Player Types, is a categorization system that classifies players of multiplayer online games based on their gaming preferences and behaviors. It was developed by Richard Bartle, a British video game designer and researcher. Bartle identified four primary player types in online games, each with distinct characteristics and motivations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Achievers:** Achievers are highly competitive and goal-oriented players. They seek to excel in the game by accumulating achievements, points, or other measurable rewards. They enjoy mastering the game's mechanics and demonstrating their skills to others. Achievers are often persistent in their pursuit of in-game success.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explorers:** Explorers are curious and adventurous players who enjoy discovering and uncovering the game's secrets. They thrive on exploration, innovation, and experimentation. Explorers are analytical thinkers who seek to understand the game world thoroughly and may focus on uncovering hidden elements or solving mysteries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Socializers:** Socializers are players who value social interaction and collaboration with others. They derive enjoyment from building relationships, forming alliances, and communicating with fellow players. Socializers are often friendly, empathetic, and cooperative, and they view the game as a means to connect with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Killers:** Killers are competitive and aggressive players who thrive on conflict and competition. They enjoy challenging other players and may engage in combat, player-versus-player (PvP) interactions, or strategic gameplay. Killers are motivated by the thrill of defeating opponents and exerting dominance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Applications of Bartle Types (TEI):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Design:** Game developers use the Bartle Types framework to design and balance games that cater to different player preferences. By understanding what motivates each player type, developers can create more engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Community Building:** Online gaming communities and guilds often use Bartle Types to understand the dynamics within their groups. Recognizing the diverse player types can help leaders foster a positive and inclusive gaming environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "##  Steps for TEI Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the (TEI) Personality Model .\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the TEI dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the TEI dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the TEI dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Initialize a `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "        * Fit the `LabelEncoder` to the 'Factor' column to create the mapping between personality factors and numerical codes.\n",
    "        * Transform the 'Factor' column using the fitted `LabelEncoder` to create a new 'Factor_Encoded' column.\n",
    "        * Save the fitted `LabelEncoder` object.\n",
    "        * Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) to show the mapping between original factors and encoded values.\n",
    "        * Save the visualization as an image file.\n",
    "        * Log the label encoder object and the visualization as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "        * Log the mapping between original factors and encoded values as a dictionary in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step prepares the target variable for model training and provides a clear representation of the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Step 6: Create our TEI Model (Model Training and Evaluation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step trains a machine learning model on the generated embeddings to predict personality factors and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Prepare the data for model training:\n",
    "            * Extract the embeddings as features (`X`).\n",
    "            * Encode the 'Factor' column using the loaded `LabelEncoder` to get the target variable (`y`).\n",
    "            * Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "        * Initialize a machine learning model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`).\n",
    "        * Train the model on the training data.\n",
    "        * Make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "        * Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix).\n",
    "        * Generate visualizations of the evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix plot).\n",
    "        * Save the trained model.\n",
    "        * Log model training parameters (e.g., hyperparameters), evaluation metrics, visualizations, and the trained model as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step is the core of the machine learning process, where the model learns to predict personality factors from the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Step 7: Model Testing (Inference on New Data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict personality factors for new, unseen text inputs.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the trained model (saved in Step 6).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Define a function that:\n",
    "            * Takes new text as input.\n",
    "            * Generates an embedding for the new text using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded model to predict the personality factor.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded `LabelEncoder` to decode the numerical prediction back to the original factor name.\n",
    "        * Provide example new text inputs.\n",
    "        * Use the function to predict personality factors for the example texts.\n",
    "        * Print the predictions.\n",
    "        * Log the test inputs and predictions in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step demonstrates the practical application of the trained model for making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Step 8: Model Application, Visualization, and Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step provides additional visualization and analysis of the data and model.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the embeddings.\n",
    "        * Generate and log PCA plots to visualize the embedding distribution.\n",
    "        * Perform K-Means clustering on the embeddings to identify potential groupings or clusters of similar personality traits.\n",
    "        * Add cluster labels to the dataset and save the clustered data.\n",
    "        * Log clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters) and the clustered data as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step offers valuable insights into the data and model:\n",
    "        * PCA visualization helps understand the distribution of embeddings.\n",
    "        * Clustering can reveal underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### InterpreTEIion:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not represenTEIive of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and represenTEIive to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-represenTEIive test set."

    "## Process for Building the TEI Personality Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Define taxonomy (`Factor \\to Adjective \\to Synonym/Verb/Noun`).\n",
    "   * Normalize lists and flatten to CSV (`TEI.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load `TEI.csv` into pandas.\n",
    "   * Initialize OpenAI client and MLflow.\n",
    "   * Generate embeddings via `client.embeddings.create(...)` for full text prompt.\n",
    "   * Save `TEI_embeddings.csv` with `Embedding` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Label Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load embeddings CSV.\n",
    "   * Fit `LabelEncoder` on `Factor` column.\n",
    "   * Save encoder (`TEI_label_encoder.pkl`).\n",
    "   * Visualize mapping with bar chart and log to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load embeddings and label encoder.\n",
    "   * Split into train/test (stratify when possible).\n",
    "   * Train `RandomForestClassifier`.\n",
    "   * Log metrics, artifacts, and model to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Reload model and encoder.\n",
    "   * Split and predict on test set.\n",
    "   * Compute accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.\n",
    "   * Log evaluation artifacts to MLflow.\n",
    "   * Perform cross-validation (LOO if class imbalance).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inference on New Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load model & encoder.\n",
    "   * Define `predict_factor(text)` helper that requests embedding and predicts.\n",
    "   * Test on meaningful example sentences.\n",
    "   * Log predictions to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualization & Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Train RF on full dataset.\n",
    "   * In‑sample evaluation & plot confusion matrix.\n",
    "   * PCA into 2D & scatter by encoded class.\n",
    "   * K‑Means clustering on embeddings, save `TEI_clustered_embeddings.csv`.\n",
    "   * Plot clusters in PCA space.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Neo4j Graph Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Clear existing graph: `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`.\n",
    "   * Ingest `TEI.csv`, create nodes for Factor, Adjective, Synonym, Verb, Noun.\n",
    "   * Create `:RELATES_TO` relationships following taxonomy hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Cypher Query to View Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```cypher\n",
