    "The Circumplex Model of Affect (CMOA) is a psychological framework used to understand and categorize human emotions based on two primary dimensions: valence and arousal. This model provides a structured way to describe and analyze a wide range of emotional experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the CMOA model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Valence**: This dimension represents the emotional quality of an experience, ranging from positive to negative.\n",
    "   - **Positive**: Emotions in this category are considered positive and include feelings such as happiness, joy, excitement, and contentment.\n",
    "   - **Negative**: Emotions in this category are considered negative and include feelings such as sadness, anger, anxiety, and disgust.\n",
    "   - **Neutral**: Emotions in this category are neither strongly positive nor negative and include feelings such as calm, serenity, relaxation, and indifference.\n",
    "   - **Pleasant**: Emotions in this category are associated with positive valence and include feelings like delight, satisfaction, cheerfulness, and gratitude.\n",
    "   - **Unpleasant**: Emotions in this category are associated with negative valence and include feelings like misery, frustration, unease, and displeasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Arousal**: This dimension represents the level of physiological activation or intensity of an emotional experience.\n",
    "   - **High**: Emotions in this category are highly arousing and include feelings such as energetic, enthusiastic, agitated, and intense.\n",
    "   - **Low**: Emotions in this category are characterized by low arousal and include feelings such as calm, relaxed, tranquil, and drowsy.\n",
    "   - **Moderate**: Emotions in this category have a moderate level of arousal and include feelings like alertness, attentiveness, engagement, and focus.\n",
    "   - **Excited**: Emotions in this category are highly arousing and include feelings like thrill, being amped up, feeling stimulated, and eagerness.\n",
    "   - **Calm**: Emotions in this category are both moderately valenced and moderately arousing and include feelings like peacefulness, placidity, soothed, and tranquilized.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The Circumplex Model of Affect (CMOA) is a psychological framework that has been developed and refined by various researchers over time. It does not have a single set of authors or originators like some other psychological theories. Instead, it has evolved through contributions from multiple researchers in the fields of psychology and affective science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key figures who have contributed to the development and application of circumplex models of affect and emotion include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **James A. Russell**: Russell is a prominent psychologist known for his work on emotion, affect, and the circumplex model. His research has significantly influenced the understanding and application of circumplex models in psychology.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Philippe Scherer**: Scherer is another influential researcher in the field of emotion and affective science. His work has contributed to the development of circumplex models, including the CMOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lisa Feldman Barrett**: While Barrett is known for her work on the constructionist theory of emotion, her research has relevance to the study of emotion dimensions and affective space, which are concepts related to circumplex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robert Plutchik**: Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion includes a circumplex model of emotions, although it's important to note that his work differs somewhat from the CMOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Klaus Scherer**: Scherer has conducted research on the structure of emotions and affective space, contributing to the broader understanding of circumplex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to recognize that the development and refinement of circumplex models of affect have been a collaborative effort in the field of psychology, and various researchers have made contributions to this area. The specific authors associated with the CMOA may vary depending on the context in which it is discussed and applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CMOA model is often used in psychology and research to better understand and classify emotions based on these two fundamental dimensions. It allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive examination of emotional experiences, making it a valuable tool for studying human affect and behavior. Researchers and practitioners use this model to gain insights into how emotions are related, how they vary in intensity and valence, and how they impact human cognition and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeline and reference table for the Circumplex Model of Affect (CMOA) involves outlining key developments of this psychological framework. The CMOA, developed by James A. Russell, is a model that categorizes emotions into a circular arrangement, suggesting that emotions have two main dimensions: valence (pleasant-unpleasant) and arousal (activation-deactivation). \n",

    "##  Steps for PAPC Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the (PAPC) Personality Model .\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the PAPC dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the PAPC dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the PAPC dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Initialize a `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "        * Fit the `LabelEncoder` to the 'Factor' column to create the mapping between personality factors and numerical codes.\n",
    "        * Transform the 'Factor' column using the fitted `LabelEncoder` to create a new 'Factor_Encoded' column.\n",
    "        * Save the fitted `LabelEncoder` object.\n",
    "        * Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) to show the mapping between original factors and encoded values.\n",
    "        * Save the visualization as an image file.\n",
    "        * Log the label encoder object and the visualization as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "        * Log the mapping between original factors and encoded values as a dictionary in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step prepares the target variable for model training and provides a clear representation of the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Step 6: Create our PAPC Model (Model Training and Evaluation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step trains a machine learning model on the generated embeddings to predict personality factors and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Prepare the data for model training:\n",
    "            * Extract the embeddings as features (`X`).\n",
    "            * Encode the 'Factor' column using the loaded `LabelEncoder` to get the target variable (`y`).\n",
    "            * Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",

    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### InterprePAPCion:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not represenPAPCive of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and represenPAPCive to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-represenPAPCive test set."

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Define taxonomy (`Factor \\to Adjective \\to Synonym/Verb/Noun`).\n",
    "   * Normalize lists and flatten to CSV (`PAPC.csv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load `PAPC.csv` into pandas.\n",
    "   * Initialize OpenAI client and MLflow.\n",
    "   * Generate embeddings via `client.embeddings.create(...)` for full text prompt.\n",
    "   * Save `PAPC_embeddings.csv` with `Embedding` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Label Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load embeddings CSV.\n",
    "   * Fit `LabelEncoder` on `Factor` column.\n",
    "   * Save encoder (`PAPC_label_encoder.pkl`).\n",
    "   * Visualize mapping with bar chart and log to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load embeddings and label encoder.\n",
    "   * Split into train/test (stratify when possible).\n",
    "   * Train `RandomForestClassifier`.\n",
    "   * Log metrics, artifacts, and model to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Reload model and encoder.\n",
    "   * Split and predict on test set.\n",
    "   * Compute accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.\n",
    "   * Log evaluation artifacts to MLflow.\n",
    "   * Perform cross-validation (LOO if class imbalance).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inference on New Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load model & encoder.\n",
    "   * Define `predict_factor(text)` helper that requests embedding and predicts.\n",
    "   * Test on meaningful example sentences.\n",
    "   * Log predictions to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualization & Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Train RF on full dataset.\n",
    "   * In‑sample evaluation & plot confusion matrix.\n",
    "   * PCA into 2D & scatter by encoded class.\n",
    "   * K‑Means clustering on embeddings, save `PAPC_clustered_embeddings.csv`.\n",
    "   * Plot clusters in PCA space.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Neo4j Graph Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Clear existing graph: `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`.\n",
    "   * Ingest `PAPC.csv`, create nodes for Factor, Adjective, Synonym, Verb, Noun.\n",
    "   * Create `:RELATES_TO` relationships following taxonomy hierarchy.\n",
