    "The **Everything DiSC Workplace Profile**, commonly referred to as **DiSC**, is a prominent and widely utilized personality assessment tool designed to enhance self-awareness, improve communication, and promote effective teamwork within workplaces. Rooted in psychological theories, this assessment categorizes individuals into distinct behavioral styles, enabling them to better understand themselves and their interactions with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features and Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Four Primary Behavioral Styles:** The DiSC assessment classifies individuals into four primary behavioral styles based on their natural tendencies and preferences. These styles are:\n",
    "   - **Dominance (D):** Individuals with dominant traits tend to be assertive, results-oriented, and direct in their approach.\n",
    "   - **Influence (i):** People with influential traits are sociable, persuasive, and enthusiastic, often seeking social interactions and engagement.\n",
    "   - **Steadiness (S):** Steadiness-oriented individuals are cooperative, stable, and patient, valuing harmonious relationships and reliability.\n",
    "   - **Conscientiousness (C):** Those with conscientious traits are analytical, precise, and detail-oriented, prioritizing accuracy and thoroughness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Personalized Profiles:** After completing the assessment, individuals receive personalized DiSC profiles, highlighting their dominant style and providing insights into their communication preferences, work tendencies, and strengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Self-awareness:** DiSC profiles encourage individuals to reflect on their behavioral tendencies, helping them gain a deeper understanding of their own strengths and areas for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improved Communication:** By recognizing their own style and the styles of others, individuals can adapt their communication approaches to be more effective in various interpersonal and professional situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Team Development:** DiSC is often used in team-building exercises to create more cohesive and harmonious work environments. Team members can understand each other's styles and work together more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Leadership Development:** The assessment is valuable in leadership development programs, helping leaders understand their leadership style and how it impacts their teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Building:** DiSC assessments are commonly employed in team-building workshops to foster better collaboration and understanding among team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leadership Development:** Organizations use DiSC to identify and develop leadership skills among employees, tailoring leadership training to individual styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conflict Resolution:** DiSC profiles can aid in conflict resolution by helping individuals understand the perspectives and communication preferences of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales and Customer Service Training:** DiSC assessments are beneficial in sales and customer service training, allowing professionals to adapt their approaches to various customer styles effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personal Development:** Many individuals use DiSC assessments for personal development, gaining insights into their own behavior and interpersonal skills.\n",

    "##  Steps for DISC Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the (DISC) Personality Model .\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the DISC dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This cdiscical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical represendiscions (embeddings) for the text data in the DISC dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the DISC dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), sdiscistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",

    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interprediscion:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not represendiscive of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and represendiscive to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-represendiscive test set."
