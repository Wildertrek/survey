    "The **Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI)** is a self-report questionnaire developed to assess *pathological* narcissism, capturing both **narcissistic grandiosity** and **narcissistic vulnerability** in one measure ([Narcissism at the crossroads: phenotypic description of pathological narcissism across clinical theory, social/personality psychology, and psychiatric diagnosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18029072/#:~:text=consistently%20describe%20variations%20in%20the,the%20diagnostic%20emphasis%20on%20overt)) ([Narcissism at the crossroads: phenotypic description of pathological narcissism across clinical theory, social/personality psychology, and psychiatric diagnosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18029072/#:~:text=grandiosity%2C%20DSM%20NPD%20has%20been,could%20lead%20to%20a%20more)). It was created by Aaron Pincus and colleagues in the late 2000s to address gaps in existing narcissism scales. The PNI provides a more clinically oriented assessment of narcissistic personality pathology compared to traditional “normal” narcissism measures ([\n",

It consists of multiple subscales that reflect maladaptive self-enhancement strategies, entitlement, and underlying emotional insecurity.

    "- **2008 – Theoretical Foundations:** Nicole M. Cain, Aaron Pincus, and Emily Ansell publish a review highlighting two phenotypic themes of pathological narcissism: **grandiose** narcissistic behaviors versus **vulnerable** self-esteem and affect. They note that clinical theories for decades described both overt grandiosity and hypersensitive vulnerability, whereas DSM criteria and common measures focused mainly on grandiosity ([Narcissism at the crossroads: phenotypic description of pathological narcissism across clinical theory, social/personality psychology, and psychiatric diagnosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18029072/#:~:text=consistently%20describe%20variations%20in%20the,the%20diagnostic%20emphasis%20on%20overt)) ([Narcissism at the crossroads: phenotypic description of pathological narcissism across clinical theory, social/personality psychology, and psychiatric diagnosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18029072/#:~:text=grandiosity%2C%20DSM%20NPD%20has%20been,could%20lead%20to%20a%20more)). This article underscored the need for a comprehensive measure covering both facets of narcissism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2009 – PNI Introduction:** Pincus et al. introduce the **Pathological Narcissism Inventory**, a 52-item self-report measure, in *Psychological Assessment*. Through four studies, they establish the PNI’s factor structure and initial validity ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=existing%20narcissism%20measures,The%20PNI)) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,and%20vulnerable%20PNI%20scales%20were)). The PNI contains **7 subscales** spanning two higher-order dimensions: narcissistic **Grandiosity** (comprising *Entitlement Rage, Exploitativeness, Grandiose Fantasy,* and *Self-Sacrificing Self-Enhancement*) and narcissistic **Vulnerability** (comprising *Contingent Self-Esteem, Hiding the Self,* and *Devaluing*) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,and%20vulnerable%20PNI%20scales%20were)). This structure was supported by confirmatory factor analysis, confirming that the PNI captures the dual nature of pathological narcissism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2012 – Validity Evidence:** Follow-up research provides **criterion validity** and clinical utility data for the PNI. For example, Lukowitsky et al. (2012) found that the PNI’s grandiosity and vulnerability scales showed distinct patterns of correlations with personality traits and psychopathology, supporting their convergent and discriminant validity ([\n",

Clinicians (both those experienced with narcissism and those without specialized training) could meaningfully predict how PNI grandiosity vs. vulnerability relate to other traits, underscoring the PNI’s clinical interpretability ([\n",

This period established that PNI grandiosity and vulnerability are **reliably distinguishable constructs** with different external correlates, aligning with expert conceptions of narcissistic personality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2013 – Continued Research:** By the early 2010s, accumulating evidence supported the PNI’s **psychometric soundness** and clinical relevance. Pincus (2013) reviewed growing findings that PNI scores are reliable and valid ([\n",
    "            Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",

Studies showed that high PNI scores are associated with a range of clinically meaningful outcomes: for instance, total PNI and its facets correlate negatively with self-esteem and empathy (as expected in pathological narcissism) and positively with shame, interpersonal distress, aggression, and borderline personality features ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=narcissism%20spanning%20problems%20with%20narcissistic,avoidant%2C%20and%20exploitable%20interpersonal%20problems)). Narcissistic **grandiosity** (via PNI) was linked to interpersonally exploitative, domineering, and vindictive tendencies, whereas narcissistic **vulnerability** was linked to internalized distress, social avoidance, and feelings of inadequacy ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=The%20PNI%20structure%20was%20validated,homicidal%20ideation%2C%20and%20several%20aspects)). Importantly, in clinical samples the PNI also showed ties to severe outcomes like self-harm, suicidality, and even homicidal ideation ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=and%20overly,several%20aspects%20of%20psychotherapy%20utilization)). These findings reinforced the PNI’s utility in capturing the maladaptive and distressing aspects of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) that earlier measures were missing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2015 – Brief PNI (B-PNI):** To improve practicality, a **short form** of the inventory was developed. Wright and colleagues created the **Brief PNI**, a 28-item version, by selecting the best-performing items from each of the 7 facets ([\n",

The B-PNI preserves the original’s factor structure (all seven subscales and the two broad composites) and demonstrates reliability and validity comparable to the full 52-item PNI ([\n",

This refinement made it easier to include a comprehensive narcissism measure in research and clinical assessments without sacrificing content coverage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2022 – State Version:** Recognizing that narcissistic expressions can fluctuate, Engyel et al. (2022) introduced a **state version** of the PNI for experience sampling. The **PNI-S** is a momentary assessment tool measuring **transient narcissistic states** (both grandiose and vulnerable) in daily life ([Frontiers | Momentarily narcissistic?

Initial studies found that the state PNI had acceptable factor structure and correlated appropriately with other narcissism measures at both the within-person (state) and between-person (trait) levels ([Frontiers | Momentarily narcissistic?

    "\n",
    "**Structure and Subscales:** As shown above, each inventory has a distinct structure. The **NPI** has a seven-factor structure identified by Raskin & Terry (1988), which largely taps traits of *grandiose narcissism* (e.g. leadership/authority, exhibitionism, entitlement) ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=,example%20of%20one%20is%20below)). The **PNI**, in contrast, includes seven facets divided into two broader domains, explicitly modeling the two faces of narcissism – it assesses not only grandiose exploitative tendencies but also vulnerable aspects like fragile self-esteem and concealment of weaknesses ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,and%20vulnerable%20PNI%20scales%20were)). The **FFNI** provides an even more fine-grained trait profile with 15 facets; these were developed by mapping narcissistic characteristics onto the well-established Big Five trait framework ([A test of the construct validity of the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23186210/#:~:text=The%20Five,good%20convergent%20and%20criterion%20validity)). Notably, both the PNI and FFNI yield separate **grandiosity** and **vulnerability** scores, whereas the NPI predominantly yields an overall narcissism score (or at best, a division into components of grandiosity) and does **not** have a built-in vulnerable narcissism scale.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Foundations:** Each measure’s design reflects different theoretical origins. The **NPI** was originally based on the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder in DSM-III, but intended for use in non-clinical populations ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=initial%20development%2C%20the%20NPI%20has,1)). It emerged from social/personality psychology to measure narcissistic traits like vanity and entitlement in the general population, often seen as an index of “normal” narcissism (sometimes even adaptive confidence) rather than pathology ([\n",
    "            Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4659764/#:~:text=amount%20of%20previous%20research%20has,2013)). In contrast, the **PNI** was grounded in clinical psychology and personality disorder theory. It draws on psychodynamic concepts (e.g., Kohut’s *narcissistic vulnerability* and Kernberg’s *pathological grandiosity*) to capture the maladaptive, distressing manifestations of narcissism ([Narcissism at the crossroads: phenotypic description of pathological narcissism across clinical theory, social/personality psychology, and psychiatric diagnosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18029072/#:~:text=consistently%20describe%20variations%20in%20the,the%20diagnostic%20emphasis%20on%20overt)) ([Narcissism at the crossroads: phenotypic description of pathological narcissism across clinical theory, social/personality psychology, and psychiatric diagnosis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18029072/#:~:text=grandiosity%2C%20DSM%20NPD%20has%20been,could%20lead%20to%20a%20more)). The **FFNI** is rooted in the Five-Factor Model of personality – its developers conceptualized narcissism as a constellation of extreme traits (especially extremely low Agreeableness, plus aspects of high Extraversion and high Neuroticism) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20factors%20%28Miller%20et%20al,Seeking%2C%20Authoritativeness%2C%20Grandiose%20Fantasies%2C%20and)). This FFM grounding means the FFNI is theory-driven from a trait perspective, attempting to integrate clinical narcissism with general personality structure ([A test of the construct validity of the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23186210/#:~:text=The%20Five,good%20convergent%20and%20criterion%20validity)). In summary, **NPI** reflects a *personality-social psychology* approach (emphasizing grandiose traits), **PNI** reflects a *clinical psychology* approach (emphasizing pathology in both grandiose and vulnerable domains), and **FFNI** reflects a *trait-model integration* approach (placing narcissism in the context of the Big Five).  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Grandiose Narcissism:** All three instruments assess narcissistic *grandiosity*, but with different nuance. **Entitlement** and **Exploitativeness** appear in each measure. For example, the NPI has an *Entitlement* subscale and items about exploiting others, the PNI includes *Exploitativeness* and *Entitlement Rage* facets, and the FFNI has trait facets for Entitlement, Exploitative tendencies, and Lack of Empathy ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20factors%20%28Miller%20et%20al,Seeking%2C%20Authoritativeness%2C%20Grandiose%20Fantasies%2C%20and)). These overlapping elements indicate consensus on core grandiose features (a sense of superiority and willingness to use others). The **NPI**, however, also contains some arguably more *benign* grandiosity facets like *Authority* (leadership/assertiveness) and *Self-Sufficiency*, which reflect confidence and independence. The PNI and FFNI tend not to frame these as positively – for instance, the FFNI’s “Authoritativeness” facet is couched in a maladaptive context (bossy, domineering tendencies), and the PNI doesn’t have a direct “leadership” scale at all (as extreme self-confidence is not necessarily viewed as pathological unless paired with entitlement or aggression). Additionally, the NPI uniquely has a *Vanity* subscale (concern with one’s physical appearance and superiority) ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=,example%20of%20one%20is%20below)), which the PNI and FFNI do not explicitly separate – vanity might be partly captured under PNI’s grandiose fantasy or FFNI’s exhibitionism, but it’s less emphasized. Thus, **NPI covers some socially bold or superficial aspects of grandiosity more than the clinically oriented PNI**, which focuses on the darker grandiose traits (rageful entitlement, fantasies of unlimited success, exploiting others).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vulnerable Narcissism:** A key difference is that the **NPI lacks measures of narcissistic vulnerability**, whereas **PNI and FFNI explicitly include them**. The PNI introduced facets like *Contingent Self-Esteem* (instability of self-worth depending on others’ validation), *Hiding the Self* (avoiding exposure of imperfections), and *Devaluing* others when disappointed ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,and%20vulnerable%20PNI%20scales%20were)) – all of which capture the fragile, defensive side of narcissism. Similarly, the FFNI includes vulnerability facets such as *Shame* and *Need for Admiration* (indicating insecurity and a desperate desire for approval), as well as *Reactive Anger* and *Distrust* which reflect hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20factors%20%28Miller%20et%20al,Seeking%2C%20Authoritativeness%2C%20Grandiose%20Fantasies%2C%20and)). These vulnerable aspects overlap conceptually with PNI’s content (e.g. both PNI and FFNI assess proneness to shame and anger when one’s ego needs aren’t met). The NPI, by contrast, was not designed to tap feelings of inadequacy or internal distress – its forced-choice items typically contrast an overtly narcissistic statement with a modest one, so respondents high in vulnerability (who might agree with self-critical or anxious statements) do not score highly on NPI. This is a fundamental distinction: **PNI and FFNI capture both “faces” of narcissism (grandiose and vulnerable)**, whereas **NPI primarily captures the grandiose face** ([\n",
    "            Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4659764/#:~:text=amount%20of%20previous%20research%20has,2013)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format and Response Style:** The NPI’s format is another notable difference. The NPI uses a **forced-choice** format (each item forces the respondent to choose between a narcissistic statement and a non-narcissistic one) ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=,example%20of%20one%20is%20below)). This can influence how results are obtained – it measures narcissism in a relatively *normative* way, possibly reducing social desirability bias for agreeing with egotistical statements (since one must choose one of two options). The PNI and FFNI use **Likert-type rating scales**, asking respondents to rate agreement with statements on a continuum. Likert scales (e.g., 0–5 or 1–5) allow capturing the degree of trait presence and tend to be more sensitive to distress and internal experiences. For instance, a PNI item like *“When others don’t notice me, I start to feel worthless”* can be rated from “not at all” to “very much,” directly tapping a vulnerable feeling that has no equivalent in the binary NPI format. The Likert format of PNI and FFNI is well-suited to clinical samples (who may strongly endorse maladaptive feelings), while the NPI’s format is geared toward detecting relative narcissistic tendencies in the general population. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique Facet Content:** Each inventory includes some unique facets that the others do not. The **PNI** has a facet called *Self-Sacrificing Self-Enhancement*, which describes doing things for others or appearing altruistic as a way to receive praise or bolster one’s self-image. This facet is a nuanced combination of grandiosity and vulnerability (a covert way to seek admiration) and is not explicitly represented in the NPI or FFNI. The **FFNI**, on the other hand, introduces facets like *Thrill-Seeking* (a tendency toward risky, excitement-seeking behavior) and *Indifference* (a lack of concern for others’ needs or feelings, conceptually akin to low empathy) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=Distrust,Acclaim%20Seeking%2C%20and%20Thrill%20Seeking)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20factors%20%28Miller%20et%20al,Seeking%2C%20Authoritativeness%2C%20Grandiose%20Fantasies%2C%20and)). While thrill-seeking is not a classic narcissistic trait per se, it correlates with the impulsivity sometimes seen in narcissistic personalities (especially overlapping with antisocial tendencies). *Indifference* (particularly when reversed, indicating hypersensitivity) ties into the FFNI’s vulnerable dimension and has some overlap with the PNI’s *Hiding the Self* or *Contingent Self-Esteem*. The **NPI** uniquely covers *Self-Sufficiency* (believing one can handle things solo and not rely on others) – PNI/FFNI do not isolate this trait, although an extreme form of self-sufficiency might be reflected in low help-seeking or distrust in those measures. In sum, there is considerable **overlap in core narcissistic themes** (entitlement, exploitation, exhibitionism) across the three inventories, but **PNI and FFNI expand into internalized insecurity** which NPI omits, and each measure includes a few distinct sub-traits aligned with its theoretical orientation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Psychometric Properties and Validity  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability (Internal Consistency):** All three inventories generally show good internal consistency for their total scores, with more variation at the subscale level. The **NPI-40** (the most common NPI form) typically yields a reliable total narcissism score (Cronbach’s alphas often in the .80s), though some of its seven subscale scores can be less reliable due to having few items per facet (e.g., the original Entitlement subscale has only a couple of items). The PNI’s scales were designed to be broader; Pincus et al. (2009) reported adequate to good alphas for the seven facets (many in the .70–.90 range) and strong reliability for the higher-order grandiosity and vulnerability composites. The **FFNI**, with 148 items, provides very robust reliability – its facet scales typically have high internal consistencies, and the composite scores for grandiose and vulnerable narcissism are highly reliable (benefiting from many items aggregating). In short, **NPI has the brevity advantage**, but its subscale fidelity is debated, whereas **PNI and FFNI, being longer and multi-faceted, achieve solid reliability** for both overall and specific dimensions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor Structure:** The structure of these measures has been studied extensively. The NPI’s factor structure has been a subject of debate – while Raskin & Terry (1988) proposed seven factors ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=4.%20,3514.54.5.890)), later research found that a shorter **three-factor** or even a two-factor (leadership/authority vs. grandiose exhibitionism/entitlement) model might better fit the data in some cases ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=match%20at%20L229%20Given%20the,10)). This inconsistency has led to critiques of the NPI’s structural validity ([\n",
    "            Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4659764/#:~:text=predominantly%20%E2%80%9Cnormal%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Cadaptive%E2%80%9D%20narcissism,Fraley%2C%20in%20press%3B%20%2028)). The PNI’s seven-factor structure (with two higher-order factors) has been supported by confirmatory factor analysis in the original study ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,and%20vulnerable%20PNI%20scales%20were)) and subsequent research, including tests of measurement invariance. The two broad PNI dimensions (grandiosity and vulnerability) are usually moderately correlated but distinguishable, which mirrors theory. The FFNI was developed with an intended structure (15 facets grouped into three FFM domains and two narcissism dimensions) and research generally supports this organization; factor analyses confirm the grouping of FFNI facets into a large **Antagonism** factor (capturing the shared core of narcissism – egocentric, callous traits) and separable aspects corresponding to grandiose (e.g. high Extraversion, low Neuroticism facets) versus vulnerable (high Neuroticism facets) narcissism ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20factors%20%28Miller%20et%20al,Seeking%2C%20Authoritativeness%2C%20Grandiose%20Fantasies%2C%20and)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/FFNI_Long.pdf#:~:text=Total%20Score%20%3D%20sum%20of,Acclaim%20Seeking%2C%20and%20Thrill%20Seeking)). Overall, **PNI and FFNI demonstrate well-defined multifaceted structures aligning with theoretical expectations**, whereas the NPI’s factor structure, while conceptually divided into facets, is sometimes treated uni-dimensionally due to ongoing debates about its exact composition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergent and Discriminant Validity:** Each inventory correlates with external variables in ways that reflect its focus. The **NPI** shows strong links with normal personality traits such as high **Extraversion** and low **Agreeableness** (especially low modesty and high dominance) ([Narcissistic Personality Inventory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_Personality_Inventory#:~:text=Rhodewalt%20%26%20Morf.,strong%20construct%20validity%20and%20ecological)). NPI scores tend to correlate with high self-esteem and low neuroticism (since vulnerable individuals score low on NPI), indicating that high NPI scorers often exhibit confident, outgoing personalities. For example, studies have found NPI scores associated with leadership emergence and extraverted behavior, as well as aggressiveness when ego-threatened (consistent with a grandiose profile). However, NPI has **weaker associations with pathology** – it often shows only modest correlations with measures of psychological distress, depression, or anxiety. In fact, the NPI has been criticized for *weak convergent validity with clinical narcissism*: many who score high on NPI do not necessarily have the impairments of NPD ([\n",
    "            Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4659764/#:~:text=amount%20of%20previous%20research%20has,2013)). Researchers have noted that some NPI items capture relatively normative traits (e.g., *“I like to take responsibility for making decisions”* might correlate with healthy leadership qualities). Thus, the NPI can be seen as measuring the **socially assertive and confident** side of narcissism more than the troubled, clinical side ([\n",
    "            Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4659764/#:~:text=amount%20of%20previous%20research%20has,2013)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the **PNI** shows a very different pattern: it correlates with a range of maladaptive outcomes. PNI *Grandiosity* scores correlate positively with traits like aggression, lack of empathy, domineering interpersonal styles, and other personality disorder features (like antisocial and histrionic tendencies) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=narcissism%20spanning%20problems%20with%20narcissistic,avoidant%2C%20and%20exploitable%20interpersonal%20problems)). PNI *Vulnerability* scores correlate with high neuroticism, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, shame, and interpersonal insecurity ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=narcissism%20spanning%20problems%20with%20narcissistic,avoidant%2C%20and%20exploitable%20interpersonal%20problems)) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=associated%20with%20cold%2C%20socially%20avoidant%2C,several%20aspects%20of%20psychotherapy%20utilization)). Importantly, PNI total and subscale scores have demonstrated links to clinical indicators such as self-harm, suicidal ideation, and poorer therapy outcomes ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=and%20overly,several%20aspects%20of%20psychotherapy%20utilization)). These correlations affirm that the PNI is tapping the **pathological expressions** of narcissism – individuals who score high on PNI tend to experience significant internal distress and interpersonal dysfunction. Notably, the PNI’s inclusion of vulnerability allows it to correlate with symptoms that the NPI would miss (e.g. PNI vulnerability correlates with emotional lability and depressive feelings). At the same time, PNI grandiosity still converges with other measures of grandiose narcissism (it does correlate positively with NPI scores and with observer ratings of narcissistic traits), but it provides a more nuanced picture by also relating to underlying distress. Overall, the PNI exhibits strong **convergent validity** with constructs like shame, entitlement, and interpersonal exploitation, and good **discriminant validity** in separating grandiose vs. vulnerable correlates ([\n",

    "\n",
    "The **FFNI** being newer, has been subject to intensive validation by its authors and others. As intended, FFNI scores align with **Five-Factor Model** traits: for instance, FFNI grandiose narcissism correlates with very low Agreeableness (high Antagonism) and high facets of Extraversion (like assertiveness), while FFNI vulnerable narcissism correlates with very low Agreeableness plus high Neuroticism (e.g., anxiety, depressiveness) and low facets of Extraversion (like low warmth) ([A test of the construct validity of the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23186210/#:~:text=behaviors%20and%20symptoms%2C%20and%20romantic,and%20vulnerable%20dimensions%20of%20narcissism)). In studies, the FFNI grandiose dimension correlates strongly with other grandiose narcissism measures (such as the NPI and the Narcissistic Grandiosity Scale), and the FFNI vulnerable dimension correlates strongly with other vulnerability measures (such as the PNI vulnerability and the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=measures%20of%20grandiose%20and%20vulnerable,Hendin%20%26%20Cheek)). One study using expert ratings found that the **FFNI’s grandiose scale** was among the **best at capturing DSM-defined narcissistic personality** (grandiose presentation), outperforming even some clinical instruments, while the **FFNI’s vulnerable scale** matched expert profiles of vulnerable NPD nearly as well as the PNI ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=measures%20of%20grandiose%20and%20vulnerable,Hendin%20%26%20Cheek)). This indicates excellent criterion validity: the FFNI can mimic how experts rate narcissistic individuals on fundamental traits. Moreover, FFNI facets show predictable relations to external criteria: e.g., *Manipulativeness, Exploitativeness,* and *Entitlement* facets correlate with observed manipulative behaviors and low empathy; *Shame* facet correlates with self-reported internalizing distress; *Thrill-Seeking* correlates with impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, etc. The FFNI thus demonstrates a **comprehensive validity** profile – it correlates with interpersonal dysfunction (due to antagonism facets), with psychopathology (vulnerability facets linking to depression/anxiety), and with aggression/risk-taking (some grandiose facets). Its incremental validity has also been tested; FFNI can explain variance in narcissistic personality pathology above and beyond what the NPI captures, thanks to inclusion of vulnerability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Clinical Utility:** In practice, the choice between these inventories can depend on the context. For **general population or social psychology research**, the NPI remains popular – it is brief and has a large research base linking it to outcomes like leadership, relationship conflict, and self-enhancement biases. However, for **clinical assessment or research on personality disorders**, the PNI and FFNI are often preferred because they assess the maladaptive range of narcissism. The PNI is particularly useful for identifying individuals who not only display arrogant, entitled behaviors but also suffer from feelings of inadequacy and emotional turmoil. The FFNI is useful when a researcher or clinician wants to understand a narcissistic individual’s broad personality trait profile (for instance, how much of their narcissism is driven by antagonism vs. neurotic insecurity, etc.). Both the PNI and FFNI have been used to explore narcissism’s connections to other disorders (like borderline personality disorder, depression, or aggression), and both show strong **construct validity** in those areas ([\n",

The NPI, while not a diagnostic tool, has predictive utility in areas such as workplace behavior, social media activity, and generational trend studies (e.g., it famously has been used to argue about increasing narcissism in younger generations). Each instrument has been validated in its sphere, but their differing focus means results are not always interchangeable – for example, a person scoring high on NPI might not score high on PNI if they lack the vulnerable tendencies, and vice versa.  \n",

    "##  Steps for PNI Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the Eysenck Personality Model (PNI).\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the PNI dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the PNI dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the PNI dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Initialize a `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "        * Fit the `LabelEncoder` to the 'Factor' column to create the mapping between personality factors and numerical codes.\n",
    "        * Transform the 'Factor' column using the fitted `LabelEncoder` to create a new 'Factor_Encoded' column.\n",
    "        * Save the fitted `LabelEncoder` object.\n",
    "        * Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) to show the mapping between original factors and encoded values.\n",
    "        * Save the visualization as an image file.\n",
    "        * Log the label encoder object and the visualization as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "        * Log the mapping between original factors and encoded values as a dictionary in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step prepares the target variable for model training and provides a clear representation of the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Step 6: Create our PNI Model (Model Training and Evaluation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step trains a machine learning model on the generated embeddings to predict personality factors and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Prepare the data for model training:\n",
    "            * Extract the embeddings as features (`X`).\n",
    "            * Encode the 'Factor' column using the loaded `LabelEncoder` to get the target variable (`y`).\n",
    "            * Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "        * Initialize a machine learning model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`).\n",
    "        * Train the model on the training data.\n",
    "        * Make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "        * Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix).\n",
    "        * Generate visualizations of the evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix plot).\n",
    "        * Save the trained model.\n",
    "        * Log model training parameters (e.g., hyperparameters), evaluation metrics, visualizations, and the trained model as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step is the core of the machine learning process, where the model learns to predict personality factors from the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Step 7: Model Testing (Inference on New Data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict personality factors for new, unseen text inputs.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the trained model (saved in Step 6).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Define a function that:\n",
    "            * Takes new text as input.\n",
    "            * Generates an embedding for the new text using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded model to predict the personality factor.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded `LabelEncoder` to decode the numerical prediction back to the original factor name.\n",
    "        * Provide example new text inputs.\n",
    "        * Use the function to predict personality factors for the example texts.\n",
    "        * Print the predictions.\n",
    "        * Log the test inputs and predictions in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step demonstrates the practical application of the trained model for making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Step 8: Model Application, Visualization, and Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step provides additional visualization and analysis of the data and model.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the embeddings.\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
