    "The **Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)** is a brief self-report measure designed to assess *covert* or *vulnerable* narcissism ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=The%20Hypersensitive%20Narcissism%20Scale%20,point%20scale)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=The%20HSNS%20is%20a%2010,Hendin%20%26%20Cheek%2C%201997)). It was developed by Holly M. Hendin and Jonathan M. Cheek in 1997 ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=A%20new%20measure%20of%20hypersensitive,Results%20support%20P)) as a refinement of earlier narcissism measures. The HSNS consists of **10 items**, each rated on a five-point Likert scale (from “very uncharacteristic” to “very characteristic”), yielding a total score from 10 to 50 ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=The%20Hypersensitive%20Narcissism%20Scale%20,point%20scale)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=The%20HSNS%20is%20a%2010,Hendin%20%26%20Cheek%2C%201997)). Administration is straightforward: respondents indicate agreement with statements reflecting feelings and behaviors (e.g. *“My feelings are easily hurt by ridicule or the slighting remarks of others.”*) that tap a narcissistic personality marked by sensitivity and defensiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical foundation:** The HSNS was inspired by the distinction between **overt (grandiose)** and **covert (vulnerable)** narcissism in personality theory ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)). Classic psychodynamic thinkers like Kernberg (1975) and Kohut (1977) proposed that narcissism has an outward, flamboyant form and a more inward, hypersensitive form ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=Narcissism%20is%20defined%20as%20a,measurably%20differentiated%2C%20and%20not%20correlated)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)). Wink (1991) empirically confirmed two “faces” of narcissism – **Grandiosity-Exhibitionism** (overt) and **Vulnerability-Sensitivity** (covert) – which were found to be essentially uncorrelated in normal populations ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)). Despite their different interpersonal styles, both types share an underlying **sense of entitlement** and **grandiose fantasies** ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=scales,measures%20that%20were%20studied%20by)). Hendin and Cheek (1997) built on this framework to create a scale specifically capturing the *covert/vulnerable* narcissistic traits often overlooked by existing measures ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=A%20new%20measure%20of%20hypersensitive,Results%20support%20P)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,Results%20support%20P)). They started with **H. A. Murray’s (1938) Narcism Scale**, a set of face-valid narcissism items developed in an early study of Harvard undergraduates ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=DSM,via%20his%20exploratory%20study%20of)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=the%20less%20well%20known%20MMPI,via%20his%20exploratory%20study%20of)). Using an empirical approach, they selected the subset of 10 items that best correlated with a composite index of **“covert narcissism”** derived from the MMPI (combining two MMPI-based narcissism scales reflecting hypersensitivity and narcissistic vulnerability) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=in%20which%20they%20developed%20an,Hypersensitivity%20Scale%29%20as)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=The%20composite%20MMPI,%CE%B1%205)). The resulting HSNS captures a personality profile of someone who is self-absorbed, easily hurt by criticism, anxious in social contexts, and defensive or resentful in response to others’ demands ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,worrying%20about%20other%20people%27s%20troubles)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)). In the authors’ words, *“we view the covert ‘face’ of narcissism as assessed by the HSNS to be one of many facets of the higher order construct that Maslow (1942) labeled psychological insecurity and that has been more recently called negative emotionality”* ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,%E2%80%A6%E2%80%8B)). Thus, the HSNS is theoretically grounded in the idea of a narcissism variant characterized by **insecurity, sensitivity, and introversion**, rather than arrogance or exhibitionism. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Traits and subscales:** The HSNS was originally presented as a **unidimensional scale**, meaning all 10 items together indicate a single covert narcissism trait ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=The%20Hypersensitive%20Narcissism%20Scale%20,The%20two)). Key themes measured by the items include **hypersensitivity to criticism**, **social anxiety or self-consciousness**, **feelings of inadequacy or shame**, **resentment of others**, and **self-absorbed attitudes** ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,worrying%20about%20other%20people%27s%20troubles)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)). For example, items probe tendencies like being easily hurt or offended, feeling that one is different from others, disliking to share credit, or being secretly annoyed by others’ requests for support ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,worrying%20about%20other%20people%27s%20troubles)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)). There are no official subscales in the original HSNS; it yields a single score representing the overall level of *hypersensitive (vulnerable) narcissism*. However, subsequent research has found that the HSNS items can be grouped into two related facets: one reflecting **hypersensitivity/neuroticism** and the other reflecting **egocentrism/entitlement** ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=from%20three%20large%20samples%20,research%20reconciles%20the%20HSNS%20with)). These correspond to the idea that vulnerable narcissism has both an **internalizing, defensive side** (e.g. feeling insecure, anxious and easily wounded) and an **antagonistic, self-centered side** (e.g. being preoccupied with oneself, unwilling to empathize or share glory). Later analyses (discussed below) have labeled these facets *“Oversensitivity”* vs. *“Egocentrism”* ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=from%20three%20large%20samples%20,research%20reconciles%20the%20HSNS%20with)). In practical terms, the HSNS is typically used as a single scale, but awareness of these subcomponents helps in interpreting the nuanced traits it measures. \n",

    "## History and Timeline  \n",
    "**1938 – Murray’s Narcism Scale:** Psychologist Henry A. Murray included a **Narcism scale** in his seminal work *Explorations in Personality* (1938). Murray’s concept of narcissism was remarkably prescient: he viewed narcissism as a blend of **vulnerability and self-absorption**, noting that narcissistic individuals may at times appear **grandiose and attention-seeking**, yet also experience **anxious self-preoccupation, hypersensitivity, feelings of neglect, and persecution** ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=DSM,via%20his%20exploratory%20study%20of)). Murray’s Narcism Scale items reflected these dual dynamics (some items tapping overt egotism and others covert defensiveness). This early measure fell out of use but later served as the basis for the HSNS. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1970s–1980s – Narcissism in Personality Research:** In the wake of Narcissistic Personality Disorder entering the DSM-III (1980), researchers developed tools to measure narcissistic traits in non-clinical samples ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=The%20clinical%20diagnostic%20criteria%20for,Grisham%2C%20Trotter%2C%20%26%20Biderman%2C%201984)). The **Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI)**, a measure of *grandiose* narcissism, was introduced by Raskin & Hall (1979) and refined by Raskin & Terry (1988). Studies soon showed that the NPI (overt narcissism) had low correlations with certain clinical narcissism scales that seemed to capture a more *hypersensitive* form ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=The%20clinical%20diagnostic%20criteria%20for,Grisham%2C%20Trotter%2C%20%26%20Biderman%2C%201984)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=principal,based)). For example, Wink (1991) found the NPI and a Narcissistic Personality Disorder scale were uncorrelated, suggesting two distinct dimensions of narcissism ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)). This underscored the need for a dedicated measure of **covert/vulnerable narcissism**. Raskin & Terry (1988) specifically pointed to Murray’s long-forgotten Narcism Scale as a promising instrument for the covert side ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=DSM,via%20his%20exploratory%20study%20of)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=the%20less%20well%20known%20MMPI,via%20his%20exploratory%20study%20of)). \n",
    "\n",
    "**1991 – Two “Faces” of Narcissism:** **Paul Wink (1991)** published a influential paper empirically splitting narcissistic traits into two factors across multiple samples ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)). He labeled them **Grandiosity-Exhibitionism** (the flamboyant, self-aggrandizing face measured by NPI and similar scales) and **Vulnerability-Sensitivity** (a shy, defensive form closer to clinical descriptions of narcissistic insecurity) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=psychodynamic%20accounts%20%28e,form%20have%20become%20accepted%20and)). Wink showed that people could score high on one and not the other, supporting the idea that overt and covert narcissism are independent. Notably, Wink observed that *both types share an underlying narcissistic core of entitlement and fantasy*, even if their outward behaviors differ ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=scales,measures%20that%20were%20studied%20by)). This work set the stage for developing covert narcissism measures, directly inspiring Hendin & Cheek. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1997 – HSNS Development:** **Hendin and Cheek (1997)** published the HSNS in the *Journal of Research in Personality* ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=ARTICLE%20NO,10%20items)). To create it, they reexamined **Murray’s (1938) Narcism Scale** by administering it to college students and correlating each item with a composite criterion of **covert narcissism** ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=in%20which%20they%20developed%20an,Hypersensitivity%20Scale%29%20as)). The criterion was a 35-item amalgam of two MMPI-based scales – the **Narcissistic Personality Disorder Scale (NPDS)** and a **Narcissism-Hypersensitivity scale** – identified by Wink (1991) as measuring the vulnerable narcissistic syndrome ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=principal,based)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=The%20composite%20MMPI,%CE%B1%205)). Out of Murray’s item pool, **10 items** showed strong correlations with this composite and were chosen for the HSNS, which demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ≈ .75) in three college samples ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=A%20new%20measure%20of%20hypersensitive,Results%20support%20P)). Crucially, Hendin & Cheek found the HSNS **correlated near zero with the NPI** (grandiose narcissism measure), while mirroring the MMPI composite’s pattern of correlations with the Big Five traits ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)). These results validated that HSNS indeed tapped a different “face” of narcissism. The authors urged personality researchers to assess **both overt and covert narcissism** in the future, as each relates to different personality profiles and outcomes ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=Personality%20Inventory%2C%20which%20assesses%20overt,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)). \n",
    "\n",
    "**2003 – Validation in Personality Disorders Research:** The concept of vulnerable narcissism gained further support in clinical research. For example, Dickinson & Pincus (2003) provided an **interpersonal analysis of grandiose vs. vulnerable narcissism**, highlighting that the vulnerable type is marked by **shame, low self-esteem, and sensitivity to criticism** ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=13.%20)). Although their study focused on pathological narcissism broadly, it reinforced the distinct characteristics that instruments like the HSNS measure (vulnerable narcissism was associated with feelings of inadequacy and interpersonal avoidance, unlike the domineering grandiose type) ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=13.%20)). Such findings helped legitimize the HSNS’s target construct within psychopathology circles. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2008 – Psychometric Review (Arble, 2008):** A master’s thesis by E. P. **Arble (2008)** took a closer look at the HSNS’s reliability and factor structure ([\n",

Using data from 298 adults, Arble found the HSNS had **high internal reliability** and clear discriminant validity – its pattern of correlations with other traits fit the theoretical profile of covert narcissism (e.g. positively related to neuroticism and introversion, and uncorrelated with overt narcissism) ([\n",
    "\"Evaluating the psychometric properties of the hypersensitive narcissis\" by Eamonn Patrick Arble\n",
    "](http://commons.emich.edu/theses/236/#:~:text=completed%20the%20measure%2C%20as%20well,psychometric%20properties%20and%20clinical%20utility)). However, **factor analysis suggested the HSNS might not be purely unidimensional** ([\n",
    "\"Evaluating the psychometric properties of the hypersensitive narcissis\" by Eamonn Patrick Arble\n",
    "](http://commons.emich.edu/theses/236/#:~:text=validity%2C%20producing%20a%20pattern%20of,psychometric%20properties%20and%20clinical%20utility)). Some items clustered separately, hinting at multiple components within the scale. The relationship between HSNS and NPI in Arble’s sample was also “somewhat unclear” (i.e. not strongly negative or positive) ([\n",
    "\"Evaluating the psychometric properties of the hypersensitive narcissis\" by Eamonn Patrick Arble\n",
    "](http://commons.emich.edu/theses/236/#:~:text=validity%2C%20producing%20a%20pattern%20of,psychometric%20properties%20and%20clinical%20utility)). The thesis concluded that HSNS is a valid measure of covert narcissism, but noted its **shortcomings (e.g. possible multidimensionality)** and suggested a **revision or expansion** to improve its psychometric properties ([\n",
    "\"Evaluating the psychometric properties of the hypersensitive narcissis\" by Eamonn Patrick Arble\n",

They translated the HSNS into Italian and administered it to clinical and nonclinical samples. Fossati’s team confirmed that the HSNS was reliable and valid in another culture, and notably they found evidence of a **two-factor structure** ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=construction%20article%2C%20the%2010%20items,%282009%3B%20Egocentrism%20and%20Oversensitivity)). Their factor analysis of the 10 items yielded two interpretable components: one reflecting **Egocentrism** (self-centered, indifferent or resentful toward others) and the other reflecting **Oversensitivity to Judgment** (insecure, hypersensitive, and shy) ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)). This two-factor interpretation aligned with the theorized facets of vulnerable narcissism and provided an empirical basis for treating HSNS as having subdimensions. Fossati et al. still supported using the total HSNS score, but their work spurred further research into the scale’s internal structure ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)). \n",

(As of 2013, this was a conference poster; it signaled ongoing refinement, though the MCNS is not yet as widely used as the original HSNS in publications.) \n",

    "**2014 – Comparative Studies:** By the 2010s, the HSNS had become a **widely used index of vulnerable narcissism** in research, often alongside grandiose measures for comparison. For instance, Miller et al. (2014) conducted a comprehensive comparison of popular narcissism scales (including NPI, HSNS, the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, and others) and their relations to external criteria ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=scales%20%28i,ratings%20on%20the%20Big%20Five)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=narcissism%2C%20including%20the%20HSNS%2C%20PNI,4%05%20measure%20of%20NPD)). They found that HSNS consistently clustered with other **“vulnerable” narcissism measures** and showed little overlap with “grandiose” measures, reinforcing the distinction. Around the same time, a Polish version (Czarna et al., 2014) was used to link vulnerable narcissism with emotional intelligence and other traits ([\n",

    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120976/#:~:text=To%20assess%20vulnerable%20narcissism%20we,My)). Such studies extended the HSNS’s validity evidence across diverse populations and contexts (e.g., linking high HSNS scores to greater neuroticism, lower extraversion, and unique outcomes like different patterns of emotional processing). \n",
    "\n",
    "**2015 – Large Sample Factor Analysis (Cheek et al., 2015):** Jonathan Cheek and colleagues followed up on the structural question in a 2015 ARP conference paper titled “Factor Structure of the HSNS.” They analyzed HSNS responses from two very large English-speaking samples (total N≈28,800) ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=researchers%20studying%20an%20Italian%20translation,components%20should%20be%20explored%20further)). Using more sophisticated tests, they again found **two factors** fit the data better than one ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)). Cheek et al. named the two subscales **“Self-Absorption”** and **“Hypersensitivity,”** noting these were conceptually equivalent to the factors identified by Fossati et al. (2009) – i.e. an *Egocentrism* factor and an *Oversensitivity* factor, respectively ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)). They recommended that researchers “explore these two components further in ongoing work on revising and expanding the HSNS” ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=factors%20to%20rotate%20indicated%20two,item%20HSNS)). This work, along with other psychometric studies, solidified the understanding that while the HSNS total score is useful, its item content is multifaceted. \n",

    "**2020s – Ongoing Research:** The HSNS continues to be studied and utilized. A recent effort by Schneider et al. (2023/2025) created a **German adaptation of the HSNS** and conducted thorough construct validation ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=The%20Hypersensitive%20Narcissism%20Scale%20,to%20map%20the%20proposed%20HSNS)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=from%20three%20large%20samples%20,research%20reconciles%20the%20HSNS%20with)). Across thousands of participants, they confirmed the **two correlated dimensions** of **Oversensitivity** and **Egocentrism** within the HSNS and mapped these onto broader personality and psychopathology models ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=from%20three%20large%20samples%20,research%20reconciles%20the%20HSNS%20with)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). They found that the **Oversensitivity subscale** (comprising the emotionally fragile, self-critical aspects) predicted *internalizing problems* like anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, aligning with “neurotic narcissism” ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=respect%20to%20various%20personality%20traits%2C,%28PsycInfo%20Database)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). The **Egocentrism subscale** (comprising the selfish, indifferent aspects) was associated with *antagonism*, low agreeableness, and externalizing tendencies (e.g. hostility), aligning it with the more *entitled/hostile* side of narcissism ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=respect%20to%20various%20personality%20traits%2C,%28PsycInfo%20Database)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). This study, published in *Psychological Assessment* in 2025, helps reconcile the HSNS with other multidimensional narcissism frameworks and underscores its continued relevance ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=Egocentrism%20overlaps%20with%20antagonistic%20narcissism%2C,to%20its%20utility%20to%20capture)). Meanwhile, cross-cultural validations (e.g. a Chinese version in 2024) have demonstrated that the HSNS reliably measures the same construct abroad, with good internal consistency (~0.78) and test-retest reliability ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=Results%20The%20exploratory%20factor%20analysis,validity%20reached%20a%20significant%20level)) ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=consistency%20reliability%20of%20the%20scale,validity%20reached%20a%20significant%20level)). These modern studies show the HSNS has stood the test of time, while also benefiting from refinements in interpretation (recognition of subfactors) and application (use in diverse samples). \n",

    "## Academic Research Findings and Comparisons  \n",
    "**Personality profile of HSNS:** Individuals who score high on the HSNS tend to have a distinctive personality profile. Consistent with the “vulnerable” narcissism characterization, HSNS scores correlate **positively with Neuroticism** and **negatively with Extraversion and Agreeableness** on the Big Five dimensions ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=Narcissism%20Scale%2C%20and%20the%20NPI,2.18)). For example, Hendin & Cheek (1997) reported HSNS had a substantial **positive correlation with Neuroticism (r ≈ +.51)** and moderate **negative correlations with Extraversion (r ≈ –.28)** and **Agreeableness (r ≈ –.44) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=Narcissism%20Scale%2C%20and%20the%20NPI,2.18))**. This indicates that hypersensitive narcissists are typically anxious, emotionally volatile, introverted, and antagonistic (skeptical or critical of others). In contrast, HSNS scores showed little relationship to Conscientiousness or Openness (small negatives) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=Narcissism%20Scale%2C%20and%20the%20NPI,2.18)), suggesting that vulnerable narcissism is not defined by those domains. These traits diverge sharply from the profile of grandiose narcissists, who are often low in Neuroticism and high in Extraversion. Indeed, the **HSNS correlates near zero (or even slightly negatively) with the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI)** ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,Results%20support%20P)), the classic measure of overt narcissism. This near-zero correlation, found in multiple studies, emphasizes that **HSNS captures a different form of narcissism** than the NPI – one more aligned with emotional insecurity than with bold self-confidence ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)). Moreover, HSNS correlates **positively with measures of introversion, anxiety, and vulnerability**. For instance, it has been linked to **low self-esteem and proneness to shame** ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=Narcissism%20Scale,to%20completely%20respond%20to%20the)), consistent with clinical observations that vulnerable narcissists privately feel inadequate even as they harbor grandiose wishes ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=13.%20)). One study noted that *rejection sensitivity* is a hallmark of hypersensitive narcissists – they have an intense fear of rejection and criticism, leading to social withdrawal and high rumination ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=%3B%20hypersensitive%20narcissism%20is%20also,10)). As a result, high-HSNS individuals often come across as **defensive, shy/avoidant, and easily hurt** in interpersonal situations ([\n",
    "            Vulnerable and Grandiose Narcissism Are Differentially Associated With Ability and Trait Emotional Intelligence - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120976/#:~:text=manner%20,2011%20%2C%20%2040)). They crave recognition to bolster their weak self-worth, but if they *feel* undervalued, they may withdraw or react with silent resentment rather than overt aggression ([\n",
    "            Vulnerable and Grandiose Narcissism Are Differentially Associated With Ability and Trait Emotional Intelligence - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120976/#:~:text=manner%20,2011%20%2C%20%2040)). This pattern can lead to difficulties in relationships and mental health. Research has found, for example, that **vulnerable narcissism (HSNS) is a risk factor for depression** – it correlates with greater depressive symptoms and may predict higher depression severity in those prone to mood disorders ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=researchers%20are%20devoting%20their%20energies,sensitivity%20is%20the%20most%20fundamental)). It is also associated with **anxiety and social insecurity**, and some evidence links it to health impacts (one study noted chronic hypersensitive narcissistic tendencies might elevate stress-related health risks like cardiovascular issues) ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=%3B%20hypersensitive%20narcissism%20is%20also,in%20social%20relationships%20raise%20the)) ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=narcissism,11)). On the interpersonal side, vulnerable narcissists do not typically lash out with open aggression unless their ego is provoked; however, when their self-image is challenged, they can display **hostile or aggressive responses** rooted in their fragile self-esteem (sometimes termed “narcissistic rage”) ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=research%20support%20that%20narcissism%20is,esteem%20and%20uncertainty%20of)). In summary, academic findings paint HSNS high-scorers as **emotionally reactive, privately self-important individuals who lack the outward confidence of grandiose narcissists**. They struggle with inner shame and insecurity, yet maintain a self-focus and entitlement that can strain their relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Use in research settings:** The HSNS has been widely used in both **personality psychology** and **clinical psychology** research as the go-to measure of **vulnerable narcissism** in non-clinical samples. Its brevity and clear focus make it convenient for large surveys and for inclusion alongside other measures. Researchers often administer the HSNS in tandem with the NPI (grandiose narcissism) to investigate how the two forms of narcissism relate differently to outcomes. For example, studies have examined how each type relates to emotional intelligence, relationship behaviors, social media usage, aggression, etc. A consistent finding is that **HSNS (vulnerable narcissism) relates to internalizing problems and inhibited behavior**, whereas NPI (grandiose narcissism) relates to externalizing behaviors and confidence. One study on emotional intelligence found that vulnerable narcissism (HSNS) was associated with lower self-reported emotional ability and more distress in handling emotions, whereas grandiose narcissism showed an opposite or nil pattern ([\n",
    "            Vulnerable and Grandiose Narcissism Are Differentially Associated With Ability and Trait Emotional Intelligence - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120976/#:~:text=manner%20,2011%20%2C%20%2040)). In personality disorder research, the HSNS has been used as a proxy for covert narcissistic traits, helping to identify individuals who might not appear narcissistic on the surface (since they may not overtly brag or seek attention) but still harbor narcissistic needs and vulnerabilities. Notably, **clinical samples** have been studied with the HSNS as well. For instance, substance abuse treatment populations have been assessed, finding that HSNS scores can predict certain maladaptive narcissistic features in those clients ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=narcissism%20is%20a%20major%20predictive,At%20the%20same%20time%2C%20hypersensitive)). Such findings suggest hypersensitive narcissism may complicate treatment, as these individuals might struggle with criticism or feedback during therapy. Overall, the HSNS has proven useful for exploring the *“shy” or covert manifestations of narcissism* in varied contexts, from college student personality surveys to psychiatric assessments, providing a fuller picture of narcissistic personality beyond the grandiose stereotype. Its continued use in contemporary research (often alongside multi-facet instruments) attests to its value in capturing an important dimension of personality. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparisons with other narcissism models:** The HSNS primarily targets what is now commonly called **vulnerable narcissism**, and it has been directly compared with other narcissism inventories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **NPI (Narcissistic Personality Inventory):** The NPI is the classic measure of *grandiose narcissism* – characterized by assertiveness, high self-esteem, exhibitionism, and dominance. As noted, HSNS and NPI scores tend to be uncorrelated or even slightly negatively correlated ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,Results%20support%20P)). Empirically, they form distinct factors. The NPI correlates with traits like high Extraversion and low Neuroticism (opposite of HSNS) ([\n",
    "            Vulnerable and Grandiose Narcissism Are Differentially Associated With Ability and Trait Emotional Intelligence - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120976/#:~:text=Grandiose%20narcissism%20is%20characterized%20by,agreeableness%2C%20and%20positively%20with%20extraversion)) ([\n",
    "            Vulnerable and Grandiose Narcissism Are Differentially Associated With Ability and Trait Emotional Intelligence - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120976/#:~:text=omnipotence,22%3B%20Zajenkowski%20and%20Czarna%2C%202015)). When factor analyses combine NPI and HSNS items, they separate cleanly into different components (one for overt, one for covert narcissism). Thus, HSNS measures aspects of narcissism that the NPI misses – namely **insecurity, defensiveness, and introverted self-absorption**, which is why incorporating HSNS can improve our ability to predict outcomes like interpersonal anxiety or depression that NPI alone cannot. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **PNI (Pathological Narcissism Inventory):** The PNI (Pincus et al., 2009) is a longer instrument that assesses both grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits, yielding two broad factors: **Narcissistic Grandiosity** and **Narcissistic Vulnerability**. The Vulnerability factor of the PNI covers things like contingent self-esteem, hiding of the self, entitlement rage, and dejection – all conceptually similar to HSNS content. In fact, HSNS shows a **strong positive correlation with the PNI’s vulnerable narcissism dimension** ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L312%20FFNI%20Vulnerable%2C,30%20facets%20of%20the%20NEO)). Studies have found these two measures largely converge; for example, one report noted the intercorrelation of HSNS with PNI Vulnerability (and with another vulnerable measure) was about r = .70 ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L312%20FFNI%20Vulnerable%2C,30%20facets%20of%20the%20NEO)). Both correlate with Neuroticism and negative affect, and both diverge from PNI’s grandiose facets. Essentially, HSNS can be seen as a *brief unidimensional proxy* for what the PNI’s vulnerable factor captures. However, the PNI, being more comprehensive, also captures some clinical nuance (like dysregulation and grandiose fantasies) that HSNS does not directly ask about. Researchers have observed that HSNS correlates highly with **self-reported shame, neediness, and depressive affects**, which overlap a great deal with PNI Vulnerability ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=13.%20)). Conversely, HSNS has minimal correlation to the PNI’s Grandiosity factor (which includes exploitative tendencies and fantasies of power). Therefore, HSNS fits neatly into the **nomological network** of narcissism as essentially measuring the *vulnerable pole* of narcissistic personality ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **FFNI (Five Factor Narcissism Inventory):** The FFNI (Glover et al., 2012) is a trait-based measure that breaks narcissism into 15 lower-level facets aligned with the Five-Factor Model, and also yields composite scores for **Grandiose** and **Vulnerable** narcissism. In comparisons, the HSNS correlates very strongly with the **FFNI Vulnerable** score and its constituent facets (like **Distrust, Shame, Need for Admiration**, etc.), which reflect high Neuroticism and low Agreeableness facets of narcissism ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20G%20PNI%20G%20NPI,47)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=narcissism%2C%20including%20the%20HSNS%2C%20PNI,4%05%20measure%20of%20NPD)). Miller et al. (2014) reported that HSNS’s profile across the NEO-PI facets was almost identical to the FFNI’s vulnerable narcissism profile ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20G%20PNI%20G%20NPI,52)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20G%20PNI%20G%20NPI,47)). For instance, both show high correlations with NEO facets such as Anxiety, Depression, Self-Consciousness, and low trust/modesty. HSNS also converges with FFNI on predicting **internalizing psychopathology** (like borderline tendencies or depressive symptoms) and on showing little relation to the FFNI Grandiose facets like authoritativeness or exhibitionism ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=FFNI%20G%20PNI%20G%20NPI,52)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=narcissism%2C%20including%20the%20HSNS%2C%20PNI,4%05%20measure%20of%20NPD)). This convergence supports the idea that whether one uses item-level factor modeling (FFNI) or the older rationally derived HSNS, one taps into the same underlying “neurotic, resentful narcissism” construct. In short, HSNS behaves as a subset of the FFNI’s vulnerable narcissism traits, particularly capturing what some have called the “negative emotionality” or *neurotic narcissism* component ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **NARQ (Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire):** The NARQ (Back et al., 2013) divides grandiose narcissism into two strategies: **Admiration** (self-enhancing, charm, assertiveness) and **Rivalry** (self-protection, defensiveness, aggression toward threats). While the NARQ primarily measures overt narcissism, its **Rivalry component** shares some features with vulnerable narcissism (e.g. hostility in response to ego threat, distrust of others). Research finds that HSNS has little in common with **Admiration** (which requires confidence and social boldness that hypersensitive narcissists lack), but may show a modest positive correlation with **Rivalry** ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=scales%20%28i,ratings%20on%20the%20Big%20Five)). This is because someone high in vulnerable narcissism can also be antagonistic or distrustful: HSNS’s *Egocentrism* facet (entitled self-focus) overlaps conceptually with the **antagonistic, low-agreeableness** aspect of Rivalry ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). For example, both HSNS and NARQ-Rivalry associate with being quick to feel slighted and to derogate others (albeit the HSNS individual might do so more covertly). However, the overlap is not complete; NARQ-Rivalry still assumes an outward assertive antagonism, whereas HSNS egocentrism is coupled with avoidant defensiveness. In the structural analysis by Schneider et al. (2025), the HSNS Egocentrism dimension mapped onto “antagonistic narcissism” and externalizing tendencies, which aligns with constructs like Rivalry ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=respect%20to%20various%20personality%20traits%2C,%28PsycInfo%20Database)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). Meanwhile, HSNS Oversensitivity mapped onto internalizing tendencies (which NARQ does not capture at all). So, one might say HSNS fills the **vulnerable niche** that NARQ leaves open. In practice, using HSNS alongside NARQ can show that not all narcissistic rivalry is loud – some of it is quiet and privately harbored. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, across these comparisons, the HSNS consistently emerges as a measure of the **“shy, hypersensitive” variant of narcissism**, complementing other instruments that capture the “bold, exploitative” variant. Its correlations with the **vulnerable scales** of multi-dimensional measures (FFNI-V, PNI-V) are high, while correlations with **grandiose scales** (NPI, NARQ-Admiration) are near zero or negative ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L615%20narcissism%2C%20including,4%05%20measure%20of%20NPD)) ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=HSNS%20and%20the%20MMPI,narcissistic%20tendencies%20in%20the%20normal)). This pattern affirms that the HSNS is an efficient way to index the vulnerable narcissism construct in research. Modern work, such as Schneider et al. (2025), further indicates that parsing HSNS into its two subcomponents can align it even more closely with those other models – with *HSNS-Oversensitivity* corresponding to what some call “neurotic narcissism” or the emotional insecurity aspect, and *HSNS-Egocentrism* corresponding to the antagonistic entitlement aspect of narcissism ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=from%20three%20large%20samples%20,research%20reconciles%20the%20HSNS%20with)) ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). Thus, the HSNS has proven academically valuable both on its own and in comparative studies, deepening our understanding of narcissistic personality by highlighting the **vulnerable side of narcissism** that earlier models did not quantify. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Creation: HSNS Trait Structure and Descriptors  \n",
    "Based on the HSNS and its identified facets, we can organize its content into a structured format of trait descriptors. Recent research suggests two main **factors** within the HSNS – which we will call **Oversensitivity** and **Egocentrism** – each encompassing several characteristics ([(PDF) Factor Structure of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336665679_Factor_Structure_of_the_Hypersensitive_Narcissism_Scale#:~:text=present%20research%20was%20to%20explore,item%20HSNS)). Below is a breakdown of each factor with descriptive **adjectives**, some **synonyms** (or related phrases), and representative **verbs** (behaviors) and **nouns** (abstract traits or tendencies) associated with that facet of hypersensitive narcissism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factor: Oversensitivity** (Hypersensitive, Vulnerable Narcissism facet)  \n",
    "  - **Adjectives:** *sensitive*, *insecure*, *defensive*, *anxious*, *self-conscious*, *introverted*, *ashamed* (easily feels shame), *touchy* (easily offended).  \n",
    "  - **Synonyms/Related Terms:** *vulnerable*, *thin-skinned*, *easily hurt*, *fragile ego*, *over-sensitive*, *prone to self-doubt*, *emotional*. (These terms all convey a tendency to feel hurt, rejected or anxious about one’s worth.)  \n",
    "  - **Verbs (Behaviors):** *overthink slights*, *take things personally*, *withdraw from criticism*, *ruminate* (over perceived offenses), *avoid the spotlight*, *feel hurt*, *crave reassurance*, *blame self*. For example, someone high in Oversensitivity might **interpret** innocuous remarks as personal attacks and **withdraw** to protect themselves ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)). They often **avoid** situations where they might be judged, and **brood** over past criticisms.  \n",
    "  - **Nouns (Traits/Tendencies):** *insecurity*, *self-doubt*, *shyness*, *fear of rejection*, *rejection-sensitivity*, *social anxiety*, *vigilance* (toward others’ opinions), *rumination*, *shame*. These nouns encapsulate the inner experience of the Oversensitivity factor – a constant sense of threat to self-esteem and an emotional vulnerability ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=%3B%20hypersensitive%20narcissism%20is%20also,10)) ([Validity and reliability of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS) in China | medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.28.24312621v1.full-text#:~:text=13.%20)). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factor: Egocentrism** (Self-Absorbed, Antagonistic Narcissism facet)  \n",
    "  - **Adjectives:** *self-centered*, *egocentric*, *entitled*, *self-absorbed*, *unempathetic*, *resentful*, *aloof*, *arrogant* (in a quiet way), *indifferent* (to others’ needs), *cynical*. Unlike the flamboyant grandiose narcissist, this egocentrism is often more covert – e.g. *secretly proud* or *secretly resentful*.  \n",
    "  - **Synonyms/Related Terms:** *self-focused*, *narcissistic* (in the classic sense), *self-important*, *insensitive*, *cold*, *calculating*, *egotistical*, *“me-first”*. These synonyms highlight a lack of concern for others and an overconcern with self. An HSNS egocentric individual may be described as *“introverted narcissist”*, *“closeted narcissist”*, or *“covertly arrogant.”*  \n",
    "  - **Verbs (Behaviors):** *dominate inner thoughts*, *neglect others*, *dismiss others’ problems*, *withhold praise* (or *credit from others*), *harbor grudges*, *refuse to share* (recognition), *expect special treatment*, *get annoyed* (when others seek help) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=of%20others%20are%20upon%20me,I%20am%20appreciated%20by%20at)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)). For example, a person high in this facet might **ignore** others’ needs, **focus** on their own interests to the exclusion of others ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)), and **resent** it when they are not given acknowledgment or when others turn to them for sympathy (seeing it as an imposition) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)). They may **secretly scoff** at others’ achievements and **feel superior** but not voice it openly.  \n",
    "  - **Nouns (Traits/Tendencies):** *self-absorption*, *entitlement*, *egocentrism*, *self-interest*, *lack of empathy*, *detachment* (from others), *grandiose fantasies* (kept private), *envy*, *resentment*. These nouns capture the core of the Egocentrism factor – a preoccupation with oneself and one’s importance, coupled with bitterness towards having to consider others. This facet ties into the “antagonistic” side of narcissism (e.g., entitlement and exploitativeness) but in a subdued form ([The Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale: Updated and extended construct validation in community samples using a newly constructed German version - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39786844/#:~:text=HSNS,2025%20APA%2C%20all%20rights%20reserved)). It reflects the *narcissistic grandiosity turned inward*: the person harbors grandiose thoughts or entitlement but feels frustrated or slighted that the world doesn’t recognize them, leading to quiet hostility. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** While we separate Oversensitivity and Egocentrism for clarity, in an individual high in HSNS both sets of characteristics often coexist and interact. For instance, a hypersensitive narcissist might feel *deep insecurity (Oversensitivity)* about their worth, yet also maintain *secret claims of superiority or entitlement (Egocentrism)* to cope with those feelings ([Untitled](http://www.sakkyndig.com/psykologi/artvit/hendin1997.pdf#:~:text=scales,measures%20that%20were%20studied%20by)). The adjectives, verbs, and nouns above can be used to construct psychological profiles or items in datasets that capture the essence of HSNS traits. They are drawn from the content of HSNS items and the literature describing covert narcissism ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,worrying%20about%20other%20people%27s%20troubles)) ([Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS)](https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/narcism-hsns.html#:~:text=,for%20my%20time%20and%20sympathy)), ensuring that the structured data stays true to the theoretical and empirical understanding of the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale. \n",

    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the HSNS dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",

    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",

    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",

    "        * Load the HSNS dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
