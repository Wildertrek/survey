    "## Development History and Structure  \n",
    "The **Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI)** was originally developed by Glover, Miller, Lynam, Crego, & Widiger in 2012 as a comprehensive measure of narcissistic traits grounded in the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=The%20Five,Miller%2C%20Lynam%2C%20Crego%2C%20%26%20Widiger)) ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=%28FFM%29,PDs)). The full FFNI contains 148 items assessing 15 trait facets that span **grandiose** and **vulnerable** dimensions of narcissism, as well as Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), from a five-factor perspective ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=The%20Five,Miller%2C%20Lynam%2C%20Crego%2C%20%26%20Widiger)) ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expressions%20of%20the%20FFM%20facets,The%20full%20FFN%20I)). The FFNI was designed based on expert surveys and literature reviews to capture maladaptive extremes of FFM traits relevant to narcissism ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=the%20creation%20of%20the%20FFNI%2C,empirical%20reviews%20were%20examined%20to)) ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=3)). For example, facets were drawn from across all Big Five domains (e.g. low Agreeableness: arrogance, exploitativeness; high Extraversion: exhibitionism, assertiveness; high Neuroticism: shame, reactive anger) that correspond to narcissistic behavior patterns ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=3)) ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=Upon%20review%20of%20these%20sources,15%20facets%20were%20necessary%20to)). Ultimately, 15 trait facets were included to represent the most common grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic presentations within the FFM framework ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=Upon%20review%20of%20these%20sources,15%20facets%20were%20necessary%20to)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The **FFNI–Short Form (FFNI-SF)** was later developed by Sherman, Miller, Few, Campbell, Widiger, Crego, & Lynam (published 2015) to provide a briefer assessment while retaining the original’s content and structure ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expressions%20of%20the%20FFM%20facets,The%20full%20FFN%20I)). The FFNI-SF contains 60 items (4 per facet) covering the same 15 trait subscales as the full FFNI ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expressions%20of%20the%20FFM%20facets,The%20full%20FFN%20I)). Item selection for the short form was based on psychometric analyses to ensure each facet’s reliability and the overall inventory’s validity remain high. Indeed, Sherman et al. (2015) reported a very high correspondence between the FFNI-SF and the full FFNI (intraclass correlations indicating strong compatibility of scores) ([](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1115015.pdf#:~:text=et%20al,SF%E2%80%99s%20original%20form%20explained)) ([](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1115015.pdf#:~:text=59,Data%20from)). The FFNI-SF maintains the ability to score **two higher-order dimensions** – **Grandiose Narcissism** and **Vulnerable Narcissism** – as in the original FFNI ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expressions%20of%20the%20FFM%20facets,The%20full%20FFN%20I)). It also reproduces an empirically derived **three-factor structure** (antagonism, neuroticism, and agentic extraversion) mapping onto FFM traits ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=two%20rationally%20created%20dimensions%20commonly,narcissism%20literature%20%E2%80%93%20grandiose%20and)). In sum, the FFNI-SF (2015) was developed to mirror the FFNI (2012) in content and theoretical basis, but with fewer items for practical efficiency, without sacrificing the nuanced trait coverage of narcissistic personality features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparisons with Other Narcissism Models  \n",
    "**FFNI-SF vs. Full FFNI:** The FFNI-SF is essentially a condensed version of the full FFNI. It retains the same 15 narcissism-related facets and two primary dimensions (grandiose and vulnerable) as the original measure ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expressions%20of%20the%20FFM%20facets,The%20full%20FFN%20I)). The main difference is length: 60 items in the short form versus 148 in the full FFNI. Psychometric evaluations show the FFNI-SF has very similar trait profiles and validity as the full FFNI, with only minimal loss of information ([](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1115015.pdf#:~:text=et%20al,SF%E2%80%99s%20original%20form%20explained)). Thus, conceptually the FFNI-SF does not differ from the full FFNI, but it offers a more efficient tool while preserving the FFNI’s five-factor trait approach to narcissism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FFNI-SF vs. Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI):** The NPI (Raskin & Hall, 1979; 40 items) is a classic measure of **grandiose narcissism**, focusing on traits like vanity, entitlement, and leadership/authority. Unlike the FFNI-SF, the NPI was not built from the five-factor trait model and largely omits **vulnerable** aspects of narcissism (e.g. insecurity or shame). In fact, research shows the NPI aligns well with grandiose narcissism but fails to capture narcissistic vulnerability ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expected%20by%20experts%20for%20measures,toward%20the%20selection%20of%20narcissism)) ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=Personality%20Inventory%20,These)). The FFNI-SF, by contrast, explicitly includes vulnerable facets (e.g. shame, reactive anger) in addition to grandiose traits, giving it a broader conceptualization. The NPI uses a forced-choice format emphasizing socially bold and self-enhancing tendencies, whereas the FFNI-SF uses a Likert format and frames narcissism as maladaptive extremes of normal traits. In sum, the NPI views narcissism in terms of overt grandiosity/vanity, while the FFNI-SF conceptualizes it as a combination of antagonism, neuroticism, and extraversion-related traits (capturing both the “bright” and “dark” sides).\n",
    "\n",
    "**FFNI-SF vs. Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI):** The PNI (Pincus et al., 2009) is a 52-item measure designed to assess pathological narcissism with **two broad factors**: Narcissistic Grandiosity and Narcissistic Vulnerability. Both the PNI and FFNI-SF recognize narcissism as a heterogeneous construct with grandiose and vulnerable manifestations. The key difference is in approach: the PNI’s content is derived from clinical theory (e.g. facets like contingent self-esteem, hiding the self, entitlement rage), focusing on self-esteem regulation failures and distress. The FFNI-SF, on the other hand, ties narcissistic behaviors to general personality traits (e.g. lack of empathy, thrill-seeking) within the FFM. Empirically, the PNI’s vulnerable scales (e.g. shame, need for others’ approval) overlap with the FFNI-SF’s vulnerable facet scores, and both have been shown to capture the core of narcissistic vulnerability well ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=Personality%20Inventory%20,These)). However, the PNI’s grandiosity scales (which include aspects like exploitativeness and grandiose fantasy) are somewhat less correlated with expert ratings of grandiose narcissism compared to the FFNI’s grandiose scale ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expected%20by%20experts%20for%20measures,toward%20the%20selection%20of%20narcissism)). In short, both inventories measure grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, but the FFNI-SF does so through the lens of fundamental personality traits, whereas the PNI emphasizes the psychopathological processes of narcissism (e.g. dysregulated self-esteem, fantasy vs. devaluation cycles).\n",
    "\n",
    "**FFNI-SF vs. Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire (NARQ):** The NARQ (Back et al., 2013) is an 18-item measure based on the **two-dimensional “Admiration–Rivalry” model** of grandiose narcissism ([Validation of the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire short scale (NARQ-S) in convenience and representative samples](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.550208.de/diw_sp0884.pdf#:~:text=for%20inventories%20that%20can%20be,Back%20et%20al)) ([Validation of the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire short scale (NARQ-S) in convenience and representative samples](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.550208.de/diw_sp0884.pdf#:~:text=and%20self,S%20as%20a%20short%20and)). It divides grandiose narcissism into **Admiration** (self-promoting, assertive, charm-driven aspects) and **Rivalry** (self-protective, antagonistic, other-derogating aspects). The FFNI-SF and NARQ share the idea that narcissism has an agentic (admiration/extraversion) component and an antagonistic component. In fact, the NARQ’s admiration scale corresponds to the assertive, status-seeking side of grandiosity, while its rivalry scale corresponds to hostile and arrogant tendencies ([Validation of the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire short scale (NARQ-S) in convenience and representative samples](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.550208.de/diw_sp0884.pdf#:~:text=for%20inventories%20that%20can%20be,Back%20et%20al)) ([Validation of the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire short scale (NARQ-S) in convenience and representative samples](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.550208.de/diw_sp0884.pdf#:~:text=respectively,scale%2C%20representative%20sample%2C%20validation%2C%20personality)). The difference is that NARQ is narrowly focused on **grandiose narcissism** only – it does not measure vulnerable feelings like shame or insecurity. The FFNI-SF provides a more granular breakdown (15 facets) and includes those vulnerable facets. Conceptually, NARQ treats narcissism as a **self-regulatory strategy** (boosting oneself versus derogating others), whereas the FFNI-SF treats it as a constellation of trait dispositions (e.g. callousness, need for admiration, etc.). Both approaches find that narcissistic antagonism overlaps with disagreeableness and hostility, but FFNI-SF extends to measuring internal distress (via neuroticism-related facets) which NARQ omits. Thus, FFNI-SF offers a broader conceptualization (grandiose + vulnerable), whereas NARQ hones in on the **“bright” vs “dark” sides** of grandiose narcissism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**FFNI-SF vs. Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (FFNI-SF):** The FFNI-SF (Hendin & Cheek, 1997) is a brief 10-item measure of **covert or vulnerable narcissism**, often termed “hypersensitive” narcissism. It was derived to capture narcissistic traits like insecurity, defensiveness, and sensitivity to criticism (in contrast to the overt narcissism measured by instruments like the NPI). The FFNI-SF’s vulnerable narcissism dimension overlaps considerably with what the FFNI-SF measures – traits such as distrust, shame, and reactive anger stemming from wounded self-esteem. Indeed, studies show the FFNI-SF correlates strongly with expert ratings of vulnerable narcissism ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=Personality%20Inventory%20,These)), similar to the FFNI’s vulnerable scale. The difference is scope: the FFNI-SF is narrowly focused on the shy, sensitive aspect of narcissism (e.g. feeling misunderstood or unappreciated), whereas the FFNI-SF covers that domain *and* additionally covers grandiose narcissism. In practical terms, FFNI-SF offers a quick gauge of narcissistic vulnerability (covert narcissism), while FFNI-SF provides a fuller profile including entitlement, exploitativeness, and admiration-seeking. The FFNI-SF conceptualizes narcissism as including hypersensitivity **and** grandiosity within one framework, whereas FFNI-SF treats hypersensitivity as a singular narcissistic trait dimension. \n",

    "## FFNI-SF Structure and Descriptive Components  \n",
    "**Factors and Subscales:** The FFNI-SF assesses **15 narcissistic traits** (subscales), each corresponding to maladaptive extremes of FFM facets. These can be grouped into two higher-order factors: **Grandiose narcissism** (11 subscales) and **Vulnerable narcissism** (4 subscales) ([(PDF) Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318605521_Five-Factor_Narcissism_Inventory#:~:text=expressions%20of%20the%20FFM%20facets,The%20full%20FFN%20I)).

    "##  Steps for FFNI-SF Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the Eysenck Personality Model (FFNI-SF).\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the FFNI-SF dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the FFNI-SF dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the FFNI-SF dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Initialize a `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "        * Fit the `LabelEncoder` to the 'Factor' column to create the mapping between personality factors and numerical codes.\n",
    "        * Transform the 'Factor' column using the fitted `LabelEncoder` to create a new 'Factor_Encoded' column.\n",
    "        * Save the fitted `LabelEncoder` object.\n",
    "        * Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) to show the mapping between original factors and encoded values.\n",
    "        * Save the visualization as an image file.\n",
    "        * Log the label encoder object and the visualization as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "        * Log the mapping between original factors and encoded values as a dictionary in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step prepares the target variable for model training and provides a clear representation of the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Step 6: Create our FFNI-SF Model (Model Training and Evaluation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step trains a machine learning model on the generated embeddings to predict personality factors and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Prepare the data for model training:\n",
    "            * Extract the embeddings as features (`X`).\n",
    "            * Encode the 'Factor' column using the loaded `LabelEncoder` to get the target variable (`y`).\n",
    "            * Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "        * Initialize a machine learning model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`).\n",
    "        * Train the model on the training data.\n",
    "        * Make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "        * Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix).\n",
    "        * Generate visualizations of the evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix plot).\n",
    "        * Save the trained model.\n",
    "        * Log model training parameters (e.g., hyperparameters), evaluation metrics, visualizations, and the trained model as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step is the core of the machine learning process, where the model learns to predict personality factors from the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Step 7: Model Testing (Inference on New Data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict personality factors for new, unseen text inputs.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the trained model (saved in Step 6).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Define a function that:\n",
    "            * Takes new text as input.\n",
    "            * Generates an embedding for the new text using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded model to predict the personality factor.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded `LabelEncoder` to decode the numerical prediction back to the original factor name.\n",
    "        * Provide example new text inputs.\n",
    "        * Use the function to predict personality factors for the example texts.\n",
    "        * Print the predictions.\n",
    "        * Log the test inputs and predictions in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step demonstrates the practical application of the trained model for making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Step 8: Model Application, Visualization, and Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step provides additional visualization and analysis of the data and model.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the embeddings.\n",
    "        * Generate and log PCA plots to visualize the embedding distribution.\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
