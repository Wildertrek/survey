    "**Note:** The **Inventory of Pathological Narcissism (IPN)** is commonly known in the literature as the **Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI)** ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)). It is a multidimensional self-report measure designed to assess pathological narcissism, encompassing both **grandiose** and **vulnerable** aspects of narcissistic personality pathology.

    "## Historical Development of the IPN (PNI) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Origins (When, How, Why):** The IPN/PNI was developed in the late 2000s by Aaron L. Pincus and colleagues, with the foundational paper published in 2009 ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)). It emerged to resolve two key problems in narcissism research: **(a)** ambiguity between “pathological” vs. “normal” narcissism, and **(b)** the insufficient scope of existing measures ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=The%20construct%20of%20narcissism%20is,Entitlement%20Rage)). Traditional narcissism scales (like the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, NPI) mainly captured **grandiose traits** in normal populations, leaving a gap in assessing the more **vulnerable, maladaptive** expressions seen in clinical narcissistic personality disorder ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=The%20construct%20of%20narcissism%20is,Entitlement%20Rage)) ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)). To bridge this gap, Pincus et al. conducted a series of studies to derive and validate the IPN/PNI, ensuring it covered the full spectrum of narcissistic pathology ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=pathological%20narcissism%20vs,The%20PNI)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foundational Research:** The seminal article *“Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory”* by Pincus et al. (2009) documented the development of the IPN/PNI ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=pathological%20narcissism%20vs,The%20PNI)). This research used large samples to identify underlying factors of pathological narcissism and confirmed a seven-factor structure via factor analysis ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)). Subsequent theoretical work by Pincus and Lukowitsky (2010) highlighted how the DSM criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) had a “criterion problem,” failing to capture covert/vulnerable narcissistic features ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=The%20construct%20of%20narcissism%20is,Entitlement%20Rage)). The IPN/PNI was intended as a solution, informed by clinical theories (Kernberg’s and Kohut’s concepts of narcissistic pathology) and empirical findings on “covert” narcissism (e.g. hypersensitivity, shame). Early validation studies showed the IPN/PNI had expected correlations: it correlated **negatively** with self-esteem and empathy, and **positively** with shame, interpersonal distress, aggression, and borderline personality organization ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=narcissistic%20vulnerability%20%28Contingent%20Self,homicidal%20ideation%2C%20and%20several%20aspects)). These patterns reinforced that the IPN was measuring maladaptive narcissism rather than normative self-confidence. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Intended Clinical Applications:** The IPN/PNI was designed for both research **and clinical contexts**. Clinically, it provides a more nuanced assessment of narcissistic pathology than existing tools. Because it assesses **grandiose** *and* **vulnerable** narcissism, clinicians can identify patients who might present with arrogance and entitlement or, alternatively, with defensiveness, shame, and fluctuating self-worth. The IPN/PNI has been shown to predict clinically relevant outcomes. For example, in a clinical sample it was significantly associated with **suicidality** (e.g. self-harm and suicide attempts) and other severe symptoms ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=Grandiose%20PNI%20scales%20were%20associated,several%20aspects%20of%20psychotherapy%20utilization)). Pincus et al. reported that higher IPN scores related to greater **parasuicidal behavior, homicidal ideation, and intensive psychotherapy utilization** ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=correlated%20negatively%20with%20self,several%20aspects%20of%20psychotherapy%20utilization)), indicating its utility in flagging at-risk individuals. Later studies have found the PNI’s “vulnerability” component in particular correlates with depression and anxiety, whereas its “grandiosity” component relates more to antagonistic interpersonal styles ([\n",

Overall, the IPN was created to improve the assessment of NPD in both **research (to integrate clinical and social/personality perspectives) and practice (to inform diagnosis and treatment)** ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=The%20construct%20of%20narcissism%20is,Entitlement%20Rage)).\n",

The inventory yields **seven clinical subscales**, each representing a distinct dimension of pathological narcissism ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)). These seven traits serve as **primary factors** of the IPN, and they roll up into two higher-order factors: **Narcissistic Grandiosity** and **Narcissistic Vulnerability** ([\n",
    "            Evidence for the criterion validity and clinical utility of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Narcissistic Grandiosity** – This higher-order domain reflects overt, outward narcissistic expressions: an **inflated self-image**, aggressiveness in asserting superiority, and lack of empathy. The IPN includes four grandiosity-related subscales ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)):  \n",
    "  - *Entitlement Rage (ER):* Pronounced anger or frustration when one’s **entitled expectations** are not met ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=1)). Individuals high in ER feel they **deserve special treatment** and react with rage or resentment when others don’t accord them the respect or privileges they expect. *(Example item: “It irritates me when people don't notice how good a person I am.”)* ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=1)).  \n",
    "  - *Exploitativeness (EXP):* A tendency to **manipulate or take advantage** of others to achieve one’s own goals ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=2)). High EXP is marked by using relationships for personal gain, deceit, and a lack of remorse for exploiting others. *(Example item: “I can make anyone believe anything I want them to.”)* ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=2)).  \n",
    "  - *Grandiose Fantasy (GF):* **Fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, or beauty** ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=3)). This facet involves an often unrealistic belief in one’s greatness or potential, with frequent daydreams about admiration and achievement. *(Example item: “I often fantasize about being admired for my accomplishments.”)* ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=3)).  \n",
    "  - *Self-Sacrificing Self-Enhancement (SSSE):* Engaging in apparently **altruistic or self-sacrificing acts primarily to bolster one’s own ego** or gain recognition. This somewhat paradoxical facet captures people who may help or give to others, but in a way that is ultimately *self*-enhancing (seeking praise or moral superiority). *(Example item: not explicitly given above, but e.g. “I try to help others so that they will admire me.”)*. **Note:** SSSE is conceptually grandiose (it’s a self-enhancement strategy), but it’s a **covert form of grandiosity**; one study noted SSSE was the only grandiose facet not positively linked to impulsive, disinhibited behavior ([Development of a Brief Version of the Pathological Narcissism ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4659764/#:~:text=Development%20of%20a%20Brief%20Version,Disinhibition%2C%20whereas%20both%20composites)) (suggesting it’s a more controlled, image-managing grandiosity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Narcissistic Vulnerability** – This higher-order domain reflects covert or “fragile” narcissistic features: an **insecure self-concept**, sensitivity to criticism, and defensive behaviors. The IPN includes three vulnerability-related subscales ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)):  \n",
    "  - *Contingent Self-Esteem (CSE):* A fragile sense of self-worth that is **highly dependent on others’ approval and admiration** ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=1.%20Contingent%20Self)). Those high in CSE experience extreme swings in self-esteem; they feel good about themselves only when receiving praise, but feel worthless or ashamed when validation is absent. *(Example item: “When people don't notice me, I start to feel bad about myself.”)* ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=1.%20Contingent%20Self)).  \n",
    "  - *Hiding the Self (HS):* The tendency to **conceal one’s weaknesses or needs** for fear of being judged or seen as inferior ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=2)). High HS individuals are socially avoidant and defensive; they withdraw or put up a facade to prevent others from seeing their perceived flaws. *(Example item: “I try to hide my weaknesses so that others don't judge me.”)* ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=2)).  \n",
    "  - *Devaluing (DEV):* **Diminishing or belittling others** as a defensive reaction when one’s esteem needs are not met ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=3)). This facet involves projecting blame or scorn onto others (e.g. viewing others as *inferior* or unworthy) to maintain a sense of superiority or to cope with inner shame. *(Example item: “I tend to view others as inferior to me.”)* ([Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) — Moriel Mental Health ||| Riverside California](https://www.morielmentalhealth.com/blog/pathological-narcissism-inventory-pni#:~:text=3)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring System:** Each of the seven subscale scores is computed by summing or averaging the item ratings for that facet. These subscales serve as **clinical scales**, meaning higher scores indicate greater presence of that maladaptive trait. The IPN can also yield composite scores: typically a **Grandiosity composite** (combining ER, EXP, GF, SSSE) and a **Vulnerability composite** (combining CSE, HS, DEV) ([\n",
    "            Evidence for the criterion validity and clinical utility of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",

Researchers sometimes use an overall total score as well (an index of overall narcissistic pathology) ([PAULSEN - DISSERTATION - FINAL VERSION](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstreams/2f65ec68-a04b-453d-add7-8d7898839d27/download#:~:text=the%20two%20general%20components%20of,Sample%201%2C%20the%20total%20score)). Pincus et al. (2009) reported good internal consistencies for all subscales (α ≈ .75–.93) and the total score (α ≈ .95) ([PAULSEN - DISSERTATION - FINAL VERSION](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstreams/2f65ec68-a04b-453d-add7-8d7898839d27/download#:~:text=%28Contingent%20Self,In%20Sample%202%2C%20the%20total)). \n",

    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3354008/#:~:text=behavior%20%28r%20%3D%20)). For instance, Tritt et al. (2010) confirmed the 7-factor structure and showed that vulnerability facets (CSE, HS, DEV) strongly relate to depressive and anxious temperament, whereas grandiosity facets (especially GF and EXP) relate to more outgoing but volatile temperament ([\n",

Such findings reinforce the **two-factor model** within the IPN and validate that it captures the intended **vulnerable vs. grandiose** distinction in narcissism ([\n",

    "## Comparative Analysis: IPN vs. Other Narcissism Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPN/PNI has become an important tool in understanding narcissism because it intentionally straddles the worlds of normal and pathological narcissism. Here we compare the IPN to several other models and measures of narcissism – highlighting overlaps in constructs and unique contributions of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI):** The term PNI refers to the same instrument as the IPN. Any comparison between “IPN and PNI” would be tautological – they are identical measures developed by Pincus et al. (the name “Pathological Narcissism Inventory” is the official one used in publications) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=PNI%20is%20a%2052,associated%20with%20vindictive%2C%20domineering%2C%20intrusive)). If the user intended PNI to mean something else, it’s worth clarifying that in contemporary psychology, PNI = IPN. In this context, we treat them interchangeably. That said, the **PNI/IPN** can be contrasted with older conceptions of **“pathological narcissism.”** Before the PNI’s development, clinicians described narcissistic patients with terms like **grandiose vs. vulnerable narcissist** (or overt vs. covert) ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=Although%20the%20DSM,11)), but there was no widely accepted multi-facet self-report measure. The PNI filled this gap by providing specific scales for those manifestations. **Unique aspects of IPN/PNI:** it was the first comprehensive measure to capture **both polarities** of narcissism in one instrument ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=of%20narcissism%20has%20led%20to,Narcissism%20Scale%3B%20Hendin%20%26%20Cheek)). It goes beyond simple entitlement or vanity (as in the NPI) by including **internalized feelings** (shame, contingent self-esteem) and defensive behaviors (hiding, devaluation). In research, the PNI’s grandiosity scales correlate with other **antagonism** traits (like vindictiveness and dominance), while the vulnerability scales correlate with **internalizing distress** (e.g. anxiety, cold withdrawal) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=correlated%20negatively%20with%20self,several%20aspects%20of%20psychotherapy%20utilization)). This dual profile aligns with theories that narcissistic personality disorder can present with either outward arrogance or hypersensitivity and depression. The PNI thus uniquely bridges personality psychology and clinical diagnosis, addressing the “insufficient scope” of prior measures ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=The%20construct%20of%20narcissism%20is,Entitlement%20Rage)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI):** The NPI is the most established measure of **“normal” or subclinical narcissism**, developed by Raskin & Hall (1979) to reflect DSM-III narcissistic traits in a non-clinical format. It consists of forced-choice items assessing vanity, entitlement, leadership, and exhibitionism. **Overlap:** The NPI and IPN share content on **grandiose narcissism** – for example, both assess **entitlement** and a sense of superiority. In fact, studies have found that NPI scores correlate **strongly** with clinical narcissism measures; one study reported *r* = 0.66 between the NPI and the MCMI Narcissistic Personality Disorder scale ([Validity of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) in a psychiatric sample - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6746921/#:~:text=Investigated%20the%20validity%20of%20the,construct%20validity%20of%20the%20NPI)), indicating that individuals scoring high on trait narcissism often show narcissistic personality features. Another study noted the NPI’s scores had a high correspondence (74% agreement) with NPD diagnoses on the MCMI in a patient sample ([Validity of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) in a psychiatric sample - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6746921/#:~:text=Investigated%20the%20validity%20of%20the,construct%20validity%20of%20the%20NPI)). This suggests the **core construct** (grandiose self-importance) is captured by both. **Differences:** The crucial difference is one of **scope and context**. The NPI primarily measures **grandiose, “adaptive” narcissism** (e.g. confidence, leadership, exhibitionism) in the general population, and does **not** capture distress or dysfunction ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)). Most people who score high on the NPI are not clinically disordered – as one source puts it, *“the NPI measures ‘normal’ narcissism… most people who score very high on the NPI do not have NPD”* ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)). In fact, the NPI tends to correlate with high self-esteem and extraversion, and *negatively* with neuroticism (i.e. less anxiety) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Rosenthal%20%26%20Hooley%2C%202010%29,development%20of%20new%20measures%20that)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=grandiosity%20as%20a%20fa%C3%A7ade%20or,In)). By contrast, the IPN/PNI’s **vulnerability scales** correlate with low self-esteem and high neuroticism (e.g. PNI total scores correlated r ≈ –.37 with self-esteem, and r ≈ +.55 with shame) ([\n",

Additionally, the IPN includes maladaptive expressions of entitlement (e.g. rage) and exploitative tendencies causing interpersonal problems, whereas the NPI includes some items that might reflect more benign pride or leadership. In summary, the IPN encompasses **NPI-like grandiosity** but adds a whole other dimension of **insecurity and psychopathology**. The two instruments often show only moderate correlation (since NPI taps mostly the grandiose component of PNI). Researchers Thomas et al. (2012) found PNI “grandiosity” and “vulnerability” composites had different patterns of external correlates, and they argued that using the PNI in clinical contexts provides criterion validity that the NPI lacks ([\n",

In practical terms: **NPI** is ideal for assessing narcissistic traits in say, a college sample or the workplace (where narcissism might manifest as boldness or arrogance but not severe distress), whereas **IPN/PNI** is better for assessing if someone has a narcissistic *personality pathology* that might impact their mental health or therapy.\n",

    "- **Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI):** The FFNI (by Glover, Miller, Lynam, et al., 2012) is another multidimensional narcissism model. It was developed slightly after the PNI, amid recognition that narcissism has multiple facets and that those facets could be mapped onto the **Five-Factor Model (FFM)** of personality ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=of%20narcissism%20has%20led%20to,Narcissism%20Scale%3B%20Hendin%20%26%20Cheek)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Five,In%20addition%2C%20there%20are)). The FFNI is a **148-item** inventory measuring **15 traits** of narcissism, each corresponding to a maladaptive extreme of an FFM domain or facet ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Five,of%20an%20FFM%20trait%20found)). For example, it includes traits like *Reactive Anger* (high Neuroticism facet), *Dominance* and *Exhibitionism* (extreme Extraversion facets), *Manipulativeness* (low Agreeableness), *Vanity* (high trait Narcissism), *Thrill-Seeking* (low Agreeableness/high Openness mix), etc ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Five,of%20an%20FFM%20trait%20found)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=of%20narcissism%20has%20led%20to,Narcissism%20Scale%3B%20Hendin%20%26%20Cheek)). **Overlap:** The FFNI’s content overlaps substantially with the IPN. Many FFNI facets parallel PNI facets – e.g. FFNI “Entitlement” and “Exploitativeness” correspond to similar entitled and exploitative tendencies as in the IPN. Both models cover **grandiose fantasies, arrogance, entitlement, exploitative behavior, and emotional reactivity**. Indeed, both aim to capture **grandiose and vulnerable narcissism** (the FFNI has higher-order scales for Grandiose vs. Vulnerable narcissism, much like the PNI) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Five,95%29%20and%20vulnerable)). In an expert-rating study, the FFNI and PNI showed very similar profiles in how well they matched the DSM-5 trait prototypical profile of NPD ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Rosenthal%20%26%20Hooley%2C%202010%29,development%20of%20new%20measures%20that)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Five,as%20measures%20that%20capture%20DSM%E2%80%93IV%E2%80%93TR)), indicating both tap the pathological construct well. **Unique aspects:** The FFNI is grounded in the **FFM (Big Five)** framework, which means it conceptualizes narcissistic traits as concoctions of extreme Big Five traits ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=with%20basic%20personality%20traits%20%28e,Narcissistic)). For instance, FFNI “Distinguishing” (a facet) might reflect extremely low Agreeableness plus high Openness manifesting as uniqueness-seeking. This FFM lens allows researchers to see how narcissism relates to general personality structure – something the IPN does not explicitly do. Additionally, the FFNI includes a facet called *Grandiose Fantasies* (similar to PNI’s GF) and a facet called *Need for Admiration* that explicitly links to narcissistic admiration–rivalry concepts. The FFNI’s developers also created a short form and have done item-response analysis to ensure each facet is unidimensional ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L769%20Five,Grandiose%20Exhibitionism%3B%20EE%20%02%20Entitlement%2FExploitativeness)). In summary, **FFNI vs. IPN**: Both are **comprehensive**, but the IPN is **clinically oriented** (derived from clinical theory and meant to signal pathology), whereas the FFNI is **structurally oriented** (derived from general personality traits). They tend to be highly correlated and often used complementarily. One study noted that the NPI (a purely grandiose measure) had the highest convergence with expert ratings of DSM NPD, but measures like PNI and FFNI were needed to capture the **vulnerable features** of narcissism that experts also recognize ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=of%20narcissism%20has%20led%20to,Narcissism%20Scale%3B%20Hendin%20%26%20Cheek)) ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Rosenthal%20%26%20Hooley%2C%202010%29,development%20of%20new%20measures%20that)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dark Tetrad / Dark Triad (DT4) Narcissism:** The “Dark Triad” refers to the overlapping trio of socially aversive traits – **Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and Psychopathy** – often extended to a “Dark Tetrad” by adding **Sadism** ([Dark Tetrad | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dark-tetrad#:~:text=The%20Dark%20Tetrad%2C%20also%20known,of%20the%20Dark%20Triad%20construct)). In these models (Paulhus & Williams, 2002; Buckels et al., 2013), **narcissism** is included as the **“socially charming but self-absorbed”** dark trait. Typically, Dark Triad researchers measure narcissism with either the NPI or a brief derived scale, focusing on **grandiose narcissism** only. For example, the Dark Tetrad is described as including *“Narcissism: a belief that one is special, gifted, obsessed with oneself and superior to others”* ([Dark Tetrad | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dark-tetrad#:~:text=People%20with%20Dark%20Tetrad%20traits,on%20measures%20of%20the%20following)). This definition mirrors the **IPN’s grandiose aspects** (especially Grandiose Fantasy and Exploitativeness). **Overlap:** IPN’s grandiosity facets (ER, EXP, GF, SSSE) overlap with the **antagonistic, entitled, and egocentric** features that narcissism contributes to the Dark Triad/Tetrad. All Dark Tetrad personalities share a tendency to view others as means to an end ([Dark Tetrad | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dark-tetrad#:~:text=Created%20with%20Sketch)), which aligns with the IPN’s Exploitativeness and lack of empathy. Additionally, Dark Triad measures of narcissism (like the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire’s Admiration component, or the Short Dark Triad’s narcissism subscale) capture **attention-seeking, grandiose self-view, and low modesty**, which correspond to IPN’s high self-enhancement and entitlement. **Unique aspects:** The Dark Triad conceptualization does **not account for narcissistic vulnerability** at all – it treats narcissism purely as a **“bright on the outside, dark on the inside”** construct (self-enhanced outwardly, callous underneath). Vulnerable narcissistic traits (e.g. shame, neediness) would actually *contradict* the typical Dark Triad profile, which is characterized by *low* Neuroticism and high self-esteem in narcissism ([Correlates of the Dark Tetrad - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502994/#:~:text=This%20study%20explored%20demographic%2C%20ideological%2C,Trait)) ([Dark Tetrad | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dark-tetrad#:~:text=Those%20with%20high%20Dark%20Tetrad,of%20the%20Dark%20Tetrad%20traits)). Thus, the IPN’s vulnerable facets are unique and *not* represented in Dark Triad models. Another difference is that Dark Triad research often emphasizes **outcomes like aggression, impulse control, or workplace behavior**, linking narcissism to things like risk-taking and competitiveness ([Correlates of the Dark Tetrad - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502994/#:~:text=personality%20test%20,with%20all%20four%20dark%20traits)). The IPN, in contrast, is used to predict outcomes in clinical domains (like suicide risk or interpersonal dysfunction). In summary, **Dark Triad narcissism** can be seen as a **subset** of IPN’s grandiose narcissism. Narcissism in DT4 overlaps chiefly with the **exploitive, arrogant, self-aggrandizing** components of IPN (and indeed, high IPN grandiosity would likely correspond to high Dark Triad narcissism). But IPN covers additional internal dynamics (e.g. contingent self-esteem) that Dark Triad models deliberately leave out.\n",

    "- **Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) – Narcissism Scale:** The MCMI is a widely used clinical inventory (Theodore Millon’s instrument) that provides diagnostic indices for personality disorders, including Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The MCMI’s narcissism scale assesses traits like **egotism, grandiosity, lack of empathy, and a sense of entitlement** consistent with DSM criteria for NPD. **Overlap:** Conceptually, the MCMI’s narcissism scale covers similar ground to the IPN’s **grandiose domain** – a person who scores high would likely exhibit arrogance, **self-importance, and exploitation of others**. Empirically, as noted above, the MCMI narcissism scale correlates strongly with trait narcissism measures. In one validation, **NPI and MCMI narcissism correlated r = .66** in a psychiatric sample ([Validity of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) in a psychiatric sample - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6746921/#:~:text=Investigated%20the%20validity%20of%20the,construct%20validity%20of%20the%20NPI)), suggesting they tap a common core of narcissism (despite one being a “normal” trait test and the other a diagnostic test). Another study found the MCMI Narcissistic scale had significant overlap with the **IPN/PNI** as well, especially on entitlement/exploitative aspects (since both were designed with DSM NPD features in mind) ([Validity of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) in a psychiatric sample - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6746921/#:~:text=Investigated%20the%20validity%20of%20the,construct%20validity%20of%20the%20NPI)) ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=developed%20by%20Theodore%20Millon%20,79)). **Unique aspects:** The **MCMI is a clinical **screening tool**** – it’s intended to *diagnose or classify* someone as having Narcissistic Personality or not ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)). It provides a single scale score (with a cutoff indicating likely NPD) rather than a nuanced facet profile. The IPN, by contrast, is **dimensional** and gives a multi-faceted profile (one can see which aspects of narcissism are pronounced). Another difference is that the MCMI is theory-driven by Millon’s model; Millon identified subtypes of narcissist (e.g. *“confident–egotistic”* which is a moderate form, versus *“narcissistic (pathological)”* vs. an even more extreme *“turbulent” variant introduced in MCMI-IV) ([[PDF] MCMI®-IV Scales | Pearson Assessments](https://www.pearsonassessments.com/content/dam/school/global/clinical/us/assets/mcmi-iv/mcmi-iv_scales.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20MCMI%C2%AE,provides%20clinicians%20with%20a)) ([[PDF] MCMI-IV comprehensive brochure - Pearson Clinical Assessment](https://www.pearsonclinical.ca/content/dam/school/global/clinical/ca/assets/mcmi-iv/mcmi-iv-comprehensive-brochure.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20MCMI,broader%20range%20of%20personality)). The IPN doesn’t label subtypes, but one could imagine a profile with high grandiosity/low vulnerability on the IPN corresponding to Millon’s *“oblivious” (grandiose) narcissist*, and a profile with high vulnerability could correspond to a *“fragile” narcissist*. In practical use, the IPN is often used alongside or after broad measures like the MCMI to **quantify the severity** of narcissistic traits or to track changes. One notable overlap in construct: **Both MCMI and IPN treat narcissism as fundamentally maladaptive**. This is in contrast to the NPI where high scores can sometimes reflect high self-esteem without pathology. In fact, researchers have noted the **NPI and MCMI are well correlated, but the NPI detects “normal” narcissism while the MCMI indicates disordered narcissism** ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)). The IPN falls closer to the MCMI’s purpose because it was calibrated on pathological expressions (it *negatively* correlates with adaptive traits like empathy and positively with pathology like identity diffusion ([\n",

    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3354008/#:~:text=fit%20data%20from%20a%20large,43))). However, unlike the MCMI, the IPN is not used alone for diagnosis – rather, it complements clinical interviews and broader inventories. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of Comparisons:** In essence, the IPN/PNI distinguishes itself by covering the **full spectrum** of narcissistic phenomena. It overlaps with traditional narcissism measures on **grandiose traits** (e.g. entitlement, exploitation, need for admiration) – these are common threads seen in NPI, FFNI, Dark Triad models, and diagnostic tools. What the IPN uniquely adds is the assessment of **vulnerable narcissism** (feelings of insecurity, hiding, shame). Other models each have their niche: the **NPI** excels at efficient assessment of *grandiose narcissism* in non-clinical settings ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)); the **FFNI** provides a deep trait-profile grounded in general personality structure ([](https://psychology.uga.edu/sites/default/files/CVs/Miller%20et%20al._2014b_Psychological%20Assessment.pdf#:~:text=Five,of%20an%20FFM%20trait%20found)); the **Dark Triad/Tetrad** situates narcissism among other “dark” traits and highlights its shared antagonistic features ([Dark Tetrad | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dark-tetrad#:~:text=Those%20with%20high%20Dark%20Tetrad,of%20the%20Dark%20Tetrad%20traits)); the **MCMI** aligns with psychiatric diagnosis and underscores narcissism’s clinical severity ([Narcissistic personality disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder#:~:text=The%20Millon%20Clinical%20Multiaxial%20Inventory,79)). The IPN intersects with all of these, but fills an important gap by explicitly measuring the internal suffering and defensive fragility that often accompanies pathological narcissism ([\n",
    "            Evidence for the criterion validity and clinical utility of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PMC\n",
    "        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3354008/#:~:text=and%20to%20view%20oneself%20as,2009)) ([Initial construction and validation of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19719348/#:~:text=narcissistic%20vulnerability%20%28Contingent%20Self,homicidal%20ideation%2C%20and%20several%20aspects)). Modern research often uses multiple measures to capture narcissism – for example, using the IPN for a rich clinical picture and the NPI or NARQ (Admiration/Rivalry Questionnaire) for distinguishing interpersonal presentation styles. Notably, all these measures show **overlapping constructs** like **Entitlement** (present in IPN, NPI, FFNI, and as a key feature in NPD criteria and Dark Triad), and **Exploitativeness/Manipulativeness** (IPN EXP, FFNI Manipulativeness, a core trait in Machiavellianism as well). However, the IPN’s inclusion of **Contingent Self-Esteem and Hiding the Self** is fairly unique, tapping into the private emotional life of narcissistic individuals that other instruments often neglect.\n",

    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the Eysenck Personality Model (IPN).\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the IPN dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the IPN dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the IPN dataset (created in Step 2).\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
