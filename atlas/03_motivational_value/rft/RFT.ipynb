    "## **Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT): Illuminating Motivation Through Two Lenses**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of human motivation, understanding the driving forces behind our actions and decisions is of paramount importance. Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT), a conceptual framework developed by eminent psychologists, Dr. E. Tory Higgins and Dr. Heidi Grant, offers profound insights into the intricacies of human motivation, carving out a path to comprehend what propels us forward and what holds us back.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Pioneers of Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This enlightening theory was meticulously crafted by the pioneering work of Dr. E. Tory Higgins and Dr. Heidi Grant. Dr. Higgins laid the foundation for RFT, while Dr. Grant contributed significantly to its further development. Their collective efforts have left an indelible mark on the field of psychology by providing a structured and comprehensive model to decode the multifaceted nature of human motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring the RFT Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of Regulatory Focus Theory lie two distinct motivational orientations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Promotion Focus**: Individuals guided by this focus are characterized by eagerness, optimism, and a passion for growth. They seek opportunities, set ambitious goals, and are driven by the pursuit of success and achievement. Creativity, adventure, and inspiration are their allies on the journey towards realizing their aspirations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prevention Focus**: In contrast, those oriented towards prevention focus are vigilant and prudent. They prioritize safety, security, and stability. Responsibility and preparedness are their watchwords as they navigate life's challenges with caution and care. They are motivated to avoid negative outcomes and maintain the status quo.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The RFT dataset**, meticulously assembled here, provides an extensive inventory of adjectives and synonyms associated with each facet of Regulatory Focus Theory. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and enthusiasts keen on unraveling the intricate dynamics of human motivation through the lens of promotion and prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory Focus Theory has illuminated various aspects of human psychology, including goal-setting, decision-making, and even marketing strategies. By exploring the RFT dataset, researchers gain a deeper understanding of how these motivational orientations shape human behavior and influence our responses to an array of life's challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we delve further into the fascinating landscape of human motivation, Regulatory Focus Theory remains an invaluable tool for deciphering the underlying motives behind our actions and decisions. It offers a roadmap to understanding why some individuals strive for success with boundless enthusiasm, while others are driven by a steadfast commitment to avoid failure. Ultimately, RFT unveils the rich tapestry of human motivation and provides insights into the diverse paths we traverse in our quest for personal and professional fulfillment.\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
