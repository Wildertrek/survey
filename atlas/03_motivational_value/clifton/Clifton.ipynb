    "##  Steps for CLIFTON Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the Eysenck Personality Model (CLIFTON).\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the CLIFTON dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the CLIFTON dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the CLIFTON dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Initialize a `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "        * Fit the `LabelEncoder` to the 'Factor' column to create the mapping between personality factors and numerical codes.\n",
    "        * Transform the 'Factor' column using the fitted `LabelEncoder` to create a new 'Factor_Encoded' column.\n",
    "        * Save the fitted `LabelEncoder` object.\n",
    "        * Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) to show the mapping between original factors and encoded values.\n",
    "        * Save the visualization as an image file.\n",
    "        * Log the label encoder object and the visualization as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "        * Log the mapping between original factors and encoded values as a dictionary in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step prepares the target variable for model training and provides a clear representation of the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Step 6: Create our CLIFTON Model (Model Training and Evaluation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step trains a machine learning model on the generated embeddings to predict personality factors and evaluates its performance.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Prepare the data for model training:\n",
    "            * Extract the embeddings as features (`X`).\n",
    "            * Encode the 'Factor' column using the loaded `LabelEncoder` to get the target variable (`y`).\n",
    "            * Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "        * Initialize a machine learning model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`).\n",
    "        * Train the model on the training data.\n",
    "        * Make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "        * Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix).\n",
    "        * Generate visualizations of the evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix plot).\n",
    "        * Save the trained model.\n",
    "        * Log model training parameters (e.g., hyperparameters), evaluation metrics, visualizations, and the trained model as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step is the core of the machine learning process, where the model learns to predict personality factors from the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Step 7: Model Testing (Inference on New Data)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict personality factors for new, unseen text inputs.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the trained model (saved in Step 6).\n",
    "        * Load the saved `LabelEncoder` (created in Step 5).\n",
    "        * Define a function that:\n",
    "            * Takes new text as input.\n",
    "            * Generates an embedding for the new text using the OpenAI API.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded model to predict the personality factor.\n",
    "            * Uses the loaded `LabelEncoder` to decode the numerical prediction back to the original factor name.\n",
    "        * Provide example new text inputs.\n",
    "        * Use the function to predict personality factors for the example texts.\n",
    "        * Print the predictions.\n",
    "        * Log the test inputs and predictions in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step demonstrates the practical application of the trained model for making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Step 8: Model Application, Visualization, and Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step provides additional visualization and analysis of the data and model.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the embeddings.\n",
    "        * Generate and log PCA plots to visualize the embedding distribution.\n",
    "        * Perform K-Means clustering on the embeddings to identify potential groupings or clusters of similar personality traits.\n",
    "        * Add cluster labels to the dataset and save the clustered data.\n",
    "        * Log clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters) and the clustered data as artifacts in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step offers valuable insights into the data and model:\n",
    "        * PCA visualization helps understand the distribution of embeddings.\n",
    "        * Clustering can reveal underlying patterns in the data.\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
