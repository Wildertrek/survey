    "## **Motivational Systems Theory (MST): Illuminating the Complexities of Human Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the intricate landscape of human psychology, understanding the multifaceted nature of motivation is a fundamental pursuit. Motivational Systems Theory (MST), a comprehensive framework developed to unravel the complexities of human motivation, offers profound insights into the driving forces behind human behavior and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Origins of Motivational Systems Theory (MST):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This theory was meticulously crafted by notable psychologist, Dr. Jeffrey A. Gray, who laid its foundation in the latter half of the 20th century. Gray's groundbreaking work in the field of psychology led to the development of MST, providing a structured and comprehensive model to decipher the intricate web of human motivations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring the MST Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivational Systems Theory categorizes human motivations into four core systems, each with its own unique set of characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Behavioral Activation System (BAS)**: BAS is associated with approach motivation, reward-seeking behavior, and positive affect. Individuals driven by the BAS exhibit traits such as ambition, goal-orientation, and positive emotions like happiness and excitement. Impulsivity and risk-taking tendencies are also part of this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS)**: BIS is linked to avoidance motivation, anxiety, and negative affect. Individuals influenced by BIS tend to avoid punishment, show caution, and experience emotions such as worry and fear. Inhibitory control and self-regulation are key components of this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS)**: This system encompasses responses to perceived threats. It includes alertness, fear, aggression, and freezing as its components. Individuals influenced by FFFS may exhibit heightened vigilance and defensive behaviors, ranging from assertiveness to immobilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Socioemotional Regulation System (SERS)**: SERS is associated with social and emotional regulation. Affiliation, empathy, self-regulation, and cooperation are the core elements of this system. Those driven by SERS value social connection, empathy, emotional control, and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The MST dataset**, represented here, offers an extensive inventory of adjectives and synonyms associated with each system within Motivational Systems Theory. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and enthusiasts eager to explore the intricate dynamics of human motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivational Systems Theory has provided profound insights into various aspects of psychology, including emotion, personality, and decision-making. By examining the MST dataset, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how these motivational systems shape human behavior and influence our responses to a wide array of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue to delve into the complexities of human psychology, Motivational Systems Theory remains an essential tool for uncovering the hidden drivers behind our actions, emotions, and motivations. It offers a roadmap to deciphering the intricate tapestry of human behavior and understanding what fuels our desires, fears, and aspirations.\n",

    "##  Steps for MST Personality Modeling Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Create the Personality Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This initial step involves defining and generating the dataset that represents the Eysenck Personality Model (MST).\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Define the MST dataset structure (e.g., using a dictionary to represent factors, adjectives, synonyms, etc.).\n",
    "        * Generate the dataset by organizing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the dataset to a CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log dataset metadata (e.g., number of rows, factors, data schema) and the dataset file itself as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step creates the raw data that will be used for embedding generation and model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: API Key Handling and Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This critical step ensures that your OpenAI API key is securely loaded and the OpenAI client is initialized. This sets the foundation for using the OpenAI API in subsequent steps.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the OpenAI API key from a secure location (e.g., a file in the user's home directory).\n",
    "        * Validate the API key (e.g., check for existence, emptiness, and potentially a basic API call).\n",
    "        * Initialize the OpenAI client (`client`).\n",
    "        * Log the API key handling process and its outcome in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step must succeed for the rest of the workflow that utilizes the OpenAI API (like embedding generation) to function. It's essential to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, invalid key) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3: Test Embedding API**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step verifies that the OpenAI Embedding API is accessible and functioning correctly.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Use the initialized OpenAI client (`client`) to make a test call to the Embedding API (e.g., by embedding a sample text).\n",
    "        * Check the API response for validity.\n",
    "        * Log the API call details and the outcome (success or failure) in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step ensures that you can successfully generate embeddings before proceeding to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Step 4: Create Embeddings for the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step generates numerical representations (embeddings) for the text data in the MST dataset using the OpenAI Embedding API.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the MST dataset (created in Step 2).\n",
    "        * Use the OpenAI client (`client`) to generate embeddings for the relevant text fields (e.g., combining factor, adjective, synonym, verb, noun).\n",
    "        * Add the generated embeddings as a new column in the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "        * Save the DataFrame with embeddings to a new CSV file.\n",
    "        * Log embedding generation parameters (e.g., embedding model used), statistics (e.g., embedding length), and the embeddings file as an artifact in MLflow.\n",
    "    * **Importance:** This step transforms the text data into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Step 5: Create and Visualize a Label Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** This step prepares the categorical labels (personality factors) for model training by encoding them into numerical values and provides a visualization of this encoding.\n",
    "    * **Actions:**\n",
    "        * Load the dataset with embeddings (created in Step 4).\n",
    "        * Initialize a `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "        * Fit the `LabelEncoder` to the 'Factor' column to create the mapping between personality factors and numerical codes.\n",
    "        * Transform the 'Factor' column using the fitted `LabelEncoder` to create a new 'Factor_Encoded' column.\n",
    "        * Save the fitted `LabelEncoder` object.\n",
    "        * Generate a visualization (e.g., a bar chart) to show the mapping between original factors and encoded values.\n",
    "        * Save the visualization as an image file.\n",

   "source": [
    "The results show that the RandomForestClassifier model trained on the dataset of embeddings has achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, which means it has correctly classified all the test samples. Here is the breakdown of the evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy:\n",
    "- **1.0**: The model has 100% accuracy, meaning it correctly classified every instance in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for each class (0 through 4) are all 1.00.\n",
    "- **Support** indicates the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Precision**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. A precision of 1.0 means that all instances predicted as a specific class were actually of that class.\n",
    "- **Recall**: This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. A recall of 1.0 means that all actual instances of a specific class were correctly predicted.\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. An F1-score of 1.0 indicates perfect precision and recall.\n",
    "- **Support**: This indicates the number of true instances for each label in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations:\n",
    "1. **Model Overfitting**: The perfect score could indicate overfitting, especially if the test set is small or not representative of unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Test Set Size**: The test set has only 24 samples, which is relatively small. It's important to ensure that the test set is large enough and representative to get a reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "3. **Data Leakage**: Double-check that there's no data leakage, meaning that no information from the test set was used during training.\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: To better assess the model's performance, consider using cross-validation to ensure the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of model performance.\n",
    "- **Larger Test Set**: If possible, increase the size of the test set to ensure the performance metrics are reliable.\n",
    "- **Feature Analysis**: Examine feature importance scores from the RandomForestClassifier to understand which parts of the embeddings contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Code for Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Perform cross-validation\n",
    "cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y_encoded, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation\n",
    "print(f\"Cross-validation scores: {cv_scores}\")\n",
    "print(f\"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We added this cross-validation step will help us verify that the model generalizes well and is not just performing well on a small or potentially non-representative test set."
