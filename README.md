# A Survey and Computational Atlas of Personality Models

This repository contains the datasets, embeddings, and visualizations associated with the paper "A Survey and Computational Atlas of Personality Models". It serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers in psychometrics, personality psychology, and computational social science.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into distinct directories for data, code, and results:

*   **`datasets/`**: Contains CSV files for various personality models and inventories.
*   **`Embeddings/`**: Contains the computational representations (vector embeddings) of the models.
*   **`notebooks/`**: **(Coming soon with next paper)** Jupyter Notebooks containing the code for data cleaning, embedding generation, and clustering analysis.
*   **`models/`**: **(Coming soon with next paper)** Saved model artifacts (e.g., cluster centers, classifiers).
*   **`graphs/`**: High-resolution visualizations of the personality models.

## Included Models

The atlas covers a wide range of personality models, including but not limited to:

*   **OCEAN** (Big Five Personality Traits)
*   **MBTI** (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)
*   **MMPI** (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory)
*   **DISC** (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness)
*   **HEX** (HEXACO model)
*   **NPI** (Narcissistic Personality Inventory)
*   **BDI** (Beck Depression Inventory)
*   **GAD7** (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7)
*   And many others (e.g., RIASEC, Enneagram, etc.)

## Usage

This data can be used to:
*   Analyze the semantic relationships between different personality constructs.
*   Visualize the "landscape" of personality models.
*   Develop or benchmark computational models of personality.
