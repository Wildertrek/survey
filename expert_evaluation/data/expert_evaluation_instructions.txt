PERSONALITY ATLAS — EXPERT REVIEW
Validation Study for the Computational Atlas of Personality Models
==============================================================================

Thank you for participating in this validation study. Your evaluation will
provide independent human expert ground truth for the Computational Atlas of
Personality Models (44 models, 358 factors, 7 categories).

This packet contains three tasks. Estimated total time: 45-60 minutes.
We recommend completing them in order: Task 3 first (quickest, 10 min),
then Task 2 (15 min), then Task 1 (25-30 min).

Note: Three models (DISC, PCT, Bartle Types) were excluded from Tasks 1-2
due to known data quality issues (factor redundancy and metadata contamination)
that are disclosed in the paper. They remain in the category taxonomy (Task 3)
for structural review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1: Item-Factor Classification (item_classification_task.csv)
Estimated time: 25-30 minutes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will see 50 text items, each associated with a specific personality model.
Your task is to assign each item to the most appropriate factor from that
model's factor list.

For each item:
1. Read the "item_text" column
2. Note which "model" the item belongs to
3. Review the "available_factors" column for that model's factor options
4. In "expert_factor_assignment", write the factor you believe best fits
5. In "expert_confidence", rate your confidence (1=guessing, 5=certain)
6. In "expert_notes", add any comments (optional)

Important notes:
- Items come from two sources: published psychometric instruments (labeled
  "human" in source_type) and LLM-generated items ("LLM-generated"). You
  do NOT need to know which is which for your evaluation.
- Some items are reverse-scored: the item may describe the ABSENCE of a
  trait. Classify based on the construct being measured, not the direction
  of the statement. For example, "I am an average person" measures
  Narcissism (reversed).
- Some items are deliberately ambiguous (boundary items). If an item could
  plausibly map to multiple factors, choose your best judgment and note
  the alternative in the notes column.
- The "available_factors" column lists all valid factors for that model.
  Choose ONLY from the listed factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2: Construct Validity Review (construct_review_task.csv)
Estimated time: 15 minutes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will review the lexical schema (5-column encoding) for 10 representative
personality models (1-2 per category). Each model's factors are encoded as:

    Factor -> Adjective -> Synonym -> Verb -> Noun

For each factor entry, please rate:
1. "appropriateness_rating" (1-5):
   1 = Inappropriate (descriptors do not capture this factor)
   2 = Poor (major issues with descriptor selection)
   3 = Adequate (captures the factor but could be improved)
   4 = Good (appropriate descriptors with minor quibbles)
   5 = Excellent (descriptors are psychometrically sound)

2. "notes": Any specific concerns, suggested replacements, or observations

The "sample_entries" column shows one representative chain per unique root
adjective in the factor, formatted as: Adjective / Synonym / Verb / Noun
(separated by ||). This displays the full semantic breadth of each factor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3: Category Taxonomy Review (category_taxonomy_review.csv)
Estimated time: 10 minutes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The atlas organizes 44 models into 7 categories. For each category:
1. "expert_appropriate": Is this a reasonable grouping? (Yes/No/Partially)
2. "models_miscategorized": List any models that belong elsewhere
3. "missing_models": Are there important models not in this category?
4. "notes": Any observations about the taxonomy structure

General questions (please add to the notes of any row):
- Is the 7-category structure appropriate, or should categories be split/merged?
- Are there important personality models missing from the atlas entirely?
- Any concerns about the theoretical foundations of the categorization?

RETURN INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please return the three completed CSV files to Joseph Raetano (jraetano@utk.edu).
Your responses will be used to:
- Compute expert-vs-classifier and expert-vs-LLM agreement statistics
- Validate the quality of the lexical encoding schema
- Confirm or revise the category taxonomy
- Report results in the paper's Expert Validation section

Your contribution will be acknowledged in the paper's acknowledgments section
(or as a co-author if the contribution warrants it -- to be discussed).
