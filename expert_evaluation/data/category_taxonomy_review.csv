Trait-Based,6,"OCEAN, HEXACO, MBTI, EPM, 16PF, Four Temperaments","Stable, lexically derived attributes and factor hierarchies (e.g., Openness, Extraversion).","Rooted in the lexical hypothesis: personality structure can be recovered from the natural language of trait descriptors. Factor-analytic studies of trait adjectives yield broad, heritable dimensions that are stable across cultures and the lifespan (Tupes & Christal, 1961; Goldberg, 1990). These are the broadest and most general models in the taxonomy; later categories specialize these broad dispositions into narrower construct domains.",Models are included here if their primary unit of analysis is a stable dispositional trait derived from factor analysis of self-/other-report questionnaires. HEXACO adds Honesty-Humility to the Big Five; MBTI uses typological (dichotomous) rather than dimensional scoring; 16PF offers 16 source traits at a finer grain; Four Temperaments is a classical proto-psychological precursor.,"Consider whether MBTI (typological, not dimensional) fits with the others. Consider whether EPM's biological grounding (Psychoticism, Extraversion, Neuroticism) makes it more clinical. Is Four Temperaments (Hippocrates/Galen) too historically distant from modern psychometrics to sit alongside OCEAN?",,,,
Narcissism-Based,10,"NPI, PNI, HSNS, DT3, DT4, FFNI, FFNI-SF, NARQ, MCMI-N, IPN",Self-regulatory strategies from adaptive leadership to maladaptive antagonism and Machiavellianism.,"Captures the granular structure of narcissistic and antagonistic personality traits that broad trait models cannot resolve. Ranges from subclinical grandiose narcissism (NPI) through vulnerable/covert narcissism (PNI, HSNS) to the socially aversive Dark Triad/Tetrad (Machiavellianism, Psychopathy, Sadism). The FFNI bridges this category to Trait-Based by mapping narcissistic facets onto OCEAN factors.","Models are included if they primarily measure narcissistic, antagonistic, or exploitative personality features. The category spans a continuum from adaptive (leadership ambition, charm) to pathological (entitlement, exploitation, sadism). Instruments range from self-report questionnaires to clinician-administered scales.",Consider whether DT3/DT4 (which include Psychopathy and Sadism) are better placed in Clinical/Health. Consider whether MCMI-N (a subscale of a clinical instrument) belongs here or with MCMI in Clinical. Is 10 models too many for one category — should Grandiose vs. Vulnerable vs. Antagonistic be separate subcategories?,,,,
Motivational/Value,6,"STBV, SDT, RFT, AAM, MST, Clifton Strengths","Intrinsic drives, extrinsic pressures, and core values that address the 'why' of behavior.","These models address motivation and goal pursuit rather than dispositional traits. STBV defines ten values in a circumplex from Self-Transcendence to Self-Enhancement. SDT focuses on innate needs (Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness). RFT and AAM capture approach/avoidance regulatory dynamics. MST integrates goals, emotions, and agency beliefs. Clifton Strengths identifies 34 talent themes for role specialization.","Models are included if their primary focus is on what drives behavior — goals, values, regulatory strategies, or talent orientations — rather than what personality traits a person has. The distinction from Trait-Based is that these models explain why people act, not how they typically behave.","Consider whether Clifton Strengths (34 talent themes, often used in organizational coaching) is more 'application-specific' than motivational. Consider whether AAM and RFT overlap too much (both involve approach vs. avoidance). Is SDT's Relatedness component better classified as interpersonal?",,,,
Cognitive/Learning,4,"PCT, CEST, SCM, FSLS","Information processing, personal constructs, learning styles, and dual-process reasoning.","These models describe how people process information, construct meaning through personal schemas, and adopt learning preferences. PCT focuses on idiographic construct systems (personal scientists). CEST proposes dual Rational/Experiential processing systems. SCM emphasizes observational learning and self-efficacy. FSLS characterizes learning preferences across four dimensions.","Models are included if their primary focus is on cognitive processing, knowledge representation, or learning style rather than stable personality traits or clinical pathology. The distinguishing feature is the emphasis on how people think and learn, not what they feel or value.",This is the smallest substantive category (4 models). Consider whether it should be merged with another category. PCT has known data quality issues (49% redundant factor clusters) noted in the paper. Consider whether FSLS (widely criticized in educational psychology for lack of validity) belongs in the atlas.,,,,
Clinical/Health,10,"MMPI, SCID, BDI, GAD-7, WAIS, TCI, MCMI, TMP, RIT, TAT","Psychopathology assessment, cognitive capacity, and projective meaning-making.","Assesses psychological dysfunction, clinical syndromes, cognitive ability, and projective interpretation. These models have the most fine-grained factor structures in the atlas (up to 21 factors for SCID and BDI), making them the hardest to classify computationally — mirroring the difficulty of differential diagnosis in clinical practice. Includes gold-standard instruments (MMPI, SCID), affective symptom measures (BDI, GAD-7), biological temperament (TCI), cognitive capacity (WAIS), and projective tests (RIT, TAT).","Models are included if they were developed primarily for clinical assessment, diagnosis, or measurement of psychological dysfunction/capacity. The category spans structured diagnostic interviews (SCID), self-report symptom inventories (BDI, GAD-7), personality-pathology inventories (MMPI, MCMI, TMP), biological temperament (TCI), cognitive testing (WAIS), and projective methods (RIT, TAT).","Consider whether WAIS (cognitive ability) and projective tests (RIT, TAT) fit with clinical symptom measures. TCI bridges clinical and trait-based (Novelty Seeking, Harm Avoidance are temperament dimensions). Consider whether this category is too heterogeneous — should Diagnostic (SCID, MMPI) be separated from Affective (BDI, GAD-7) and Projective (RIT, TAT)?",,,,
Interpersonal/Conflict,2,"DISC, TKI","Social navigation, negotiation styles, and conflict-handling modes.","These models focus on observable interpersonal behavior in social and organizational contexts. TKI identifies five conflict-handling modes along Assertiveness and Cooperativeness dimensions. DiSC classifies workplace communication into four behavioral styles (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness).","Models are included if their primary focus is on interpersonal behavior patterns in dyadic or group contexts, rather than internal traits or clinical states. The emphasis is on how people interact, negotiate, and resolve conflict.","This is the smallest category (2 models). DiSC has known data quality issues (47% metadata rows) noted in the paper. Consider whether this category should be merged with Trait-Based (interpersonal style is arguably a trait) or Application-Specific (both models are heavily used in organizational consulting). Are there other interpersonal models missing (e.g., Interpersonal Circumplex, FIRO-B)?",,,,
Application-Specific & Holistic,6,"RIASEC, CMOA, TEI, BT, EM, PAPC","Domain-specific frameworks (vocational, gaming) and integrative affect/arousal systems.",Combines domain-specific frameworks with integrative personality systems. RIASEC maps vocational interests to six personality-environment types. CMOA organizes emotion along continuous Valence and Arousal dimensions. TEI operationalizes emotional intelligence abilities. BT defines four gaming archetypes. EM classifies nine motivation-based personality types. PAPC provides a descriptive ontology integrating psychological and social domains.,"Models are included here if they serve a specific applied domain (vocational counseling, gaming, affective computing) or provide a holistic integrative framework that doesn't fit neatly into other categories. This is intentionally the most heterogeneous category.","Consider whether EM (Enneagram) is better placed in Trait-Based or Motivational (it describes core motivations driving personality types). Consider whether TEI overlaps with Cognitive/Learning (emotional processing) or Clinical/Health (emotional regulation). Is BT (Bartle Types, gaming-specific with known 25% lexical overlap) too niche for the atlas? Should CMOA (affect model, not personality per se) be in Clinical/Health?",,,,
